The named objects magically appear in the chest, provided they can all fit inside it and the chest doesn't contain anything else. For example, the chest can conjure a plate of strawberries, a bowl of hot soup, a flagon of water, a stuffed animal, or a bag of twenty caltrops. Food and drink conjured by the chest are delicious, and they spoil if not consumed after 24 hours. Gems and precious metals created by the chest disappear after 1 minute. The chest regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn. If the item's last charge is expended, roll a d20. On a 1, the chest loses its magic (becoming an ordinary chest), and its gemstones turn to dust."

    "Description": "The Accounting and Valuation of All Things is bound in gold leaf, with pages of silver and text of blood. This is a magic tome that functions as a spellbook and arcane focus. You have a +3 bonus to your spell attack and spell save DC. Random Properties: The Accounting and Valuation of All Things has the following random properties: 1 major beneficial property 1 major detrimental property The Soul Trade: One section of the book is dedicated to negotiating and valuing mortal souls. When the book is opened within 10 feet of a creature with a soul, that creature must make a 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the tome analyzes their greatest desires and calculates exactly what they would need to give up their soul. That information is then displayed within the tome, such that the user can offer a trade to acquire a soul. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw simply show up as a question mark in the book's pages and are immune to further valuations. Mammon's Tax: When the Accounting and Valuation of All Things is used as a spellbook, it maintains a unique ability to forcibly acquire souls. Any creature killed by a spell transcribed within the book has their soul ripped from their body and sent to Minauros. This process renders the subject immune to all forms of resurrection aside from Resurrection. In payment for their soul, Mammon drops gold equal to (20 × CR) or (2 × Level) on their corpse. Negotiation Tactics: The tome is capable of providing some assistance to all negotiations, not just those made for souls. You gain a passive +5 to Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to barter. Additionally, as an action, you can surrender your consciousness to the tome, allowing it to take over. For 1 minute, the Accounting and Valuation of All Things speaks for you, using a +12 Charisma (Persuasion) skill and gaining advantage on your rolls. Using the book in this manner has a corrupting influence, and each use compels you to become increasingly greedy, vain, and evil—much like its original owner, Mammon. When the duration ends, if your alignment is non-evil, you suffer 6d6 necrotic damage. Transcribed Spells: The spellbook section of the Accounting and Valuation of All Things comes with some spells already recorded. For each spell level, roll (1). The DM will determine the necessary spells of each level that already exist within the tome. If you copy spells from the tome to your own spellbook, the cost in gold is doubled. On the opposite end, copying spells from your spellbook to the tome only costs half the gold it normally would. Destroying the Tome: Destroying the Accounting and Valuation of All Things can be done in two ways. The first option is a simple bribe to Mammon to have him destroy the tome. An offering of 99,999 gp must be made, at midnight, by opening the book and placing the gold inside. If Mammon accepts the offering, the gold melts around the book, then both vanish. The second route, in case Mammon is unavailable or unwilling, is to incinerate the book. To accomplish this task, a pot of platinum (valued at no less than 99,999 gp) must be melted, enough to fully submerge the book. Once the platinum is prepared, dropping the tome into the molten solution melts the tome. The process completely destroys the tome, as well as the platinum."

Blessing of the Forge: If you are a worshiper of Purphoros, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:  If you aren't a worshiper of Purphoros, the hammer has 2 randomly determined minor detrimental properties. See Artifacts in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties. Reforged: While holding the hammer, you have resistance to fire damage and are immune to exhaustion. Additionally, you have proficiency with PHB and have advantage on all ability checks made using them. Spells: While the hammer is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18): objects, metal, fabricate, weapon, mending, shatter. Once you use the hammer to cast a spell, the spell can't be cast again from it until the next dusk. Destroying the Hammer: To destroy the hammer, it must be taken to the realm of Tizerus, in the Underworld. There it must be coated in clay from the Mire of Punishment. The heat of the hammer hardens the clay, which fuses to it after one month. Once fully hardened, the clay-covered hammer must be swallowed and digested by a kraken."

You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it: If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the transmutation school. As an action, you can touch a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried and spend a number of charges to transform the target into another object. For 1 charge, the object can be no larger than 1 foot on a side. You can spend additional charges to increase the maximum dimensions by 2 feet per charge. The new object must have a gold value equal to or less than the original."

The amulet has 6 charges and regains 1d6 charges daily at dawn. While wearing the amulet, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to transport yourself and anything you are wearing or carrying to a location within 100 feet of you. The destination you choose doesn't need to be in your line of sight, but it must be familiar to you (in other words, a place you have seen or visited), and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. This effect isn't subject to the magic restrictions placed on the Tomb of the Nine Gods; thus, the amulet can be used to enter and exit the tomb. If you aren't undead, you must make a 16 Constitution saving throw each time you use the amulet to teleport. On a failed saving throw, the black skull cackles as you are transformed in transit. The transformation takes effect as soon as you arrive at the destination, and is determined randomly by rolling percentile dice and consulting the Black Skull Transformation table."

Recognizing the strength and inner fire of Fierna, the warlock gifted her with the Amulet of the Inferno, and it has been around her neck ever since. The Amulet of the Inferno is a magic necklace that grants a +3 bonus to spell save DC and spell attack bonus. Random Properties: The Amulet of the Inferno has the following random properties: 3 major beneficial properties 2 major detrimental properties Infernal Fire: While worn, the amulet augments any magical flames created by you, transforming normal fire into Hellfire. Hellfire ignores resistances and immunities to fire damage and deals double damage to creatures vulnerable to either fire or necrotic damage. It is also capable of melting stone, as well as igniting flammable objects. Raging Inferno: While attuned to the Amulet of the Inferno, you may use a bonus action to cast Bolt or Flame. The cantrips scale based on your total character level and use Intelligence as a spellcasting modifier if you're normally incapable of casting spells. Everburning: The Amulet of the Inferno grants resistance to cold damage and the ability to breathe underwater. Any magical flames you conjure are similarly augmented: they can be used underwater, can't be extinguished through any means, and can exude any temperature. While the casting of a fire spell can still be interrupted with Counterspell, once the spell has been cast, any lingering flames can't be removed. Destroying the Amulet: The only creature capable of destroying the amulet is the warlock that created it. Nobody living knows the warlock's identity, making destroying the amulet almost impossible."

After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.

Each creature in that line must make a 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water. Fire Jet: The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. Frost Shot: The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Lightning Shot: The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save. Poison Spray: The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."

    "Description": "Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol. Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Pick, the Forge, the Songs, and the Hammer. With them, he forged the Lords. Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations. Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. Magic Weapon: The Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a dwarvenkind, a thrower, and a sharpness. Random Properties: The axe has the following randomly determined properties: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 major beneficial property 2 minor detrimental properties Blessings of Moradin: If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits: You have immunity to poison damage. The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet. You gain proficiency with PHB related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry. Conjure Earth Elemental: If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the elemental spell from it, summoning an elemental. You can't use this property again until the next dawn. Travel the Depths: You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed. Curse: The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a restoration or curse spell. Destroying the Axe: The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed."

Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or at your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Illumination: While holding the axe, you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Sentience: Azuredge is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense the presence of non-lawful creatures within 120 feet of it. Personality: Azuredge is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city's defense. The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder. If someone tries to use Azuredge against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can't be wielded. Nothing short of a wish spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time."

While holding the broom, you can take a XPHB action to transform it into an XMM under your control. The broom then moves into an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The broom acts immediately after you on your XPHB count and remains animate until you take a XPHB and use a command word to render it inanimate. On your turn, you can mentally command the animated broom if it is within 30 feet of you and you don't have the XPHB condition (no action required). You decide what action the broom takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. If the broom is reduced to 0 XPHB, it shatters and is destroyed. If the broom reverts to its inanimate form before losing all its XPHB it regains all of them."

    "Description": "The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn. Random Properties: This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the Artifacts section of the DMG: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 major beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property Properties of the Mortar: The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature. Properties of the Pestle: The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Perfect Tools: While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. You can also use the artifact as PHB, PHB, PHB, an PHB, and a PHB. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools. Primal Parts: As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles. Traverse the Night: If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later. Bones Know Their Home: When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute. Destroying the Mortar and Pestle: The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the Yaga or by Baba Yaga herself."

The scale remains motionless if it detects nothing, tips to one side or the other for good (consecrated) or evil (desecrated), and fluctuates slightly if it detects a creature appropriate to the spell but neither good nor evil. By touching the scales after casting the ritual, you instantly learn any information the spell can normally convey, and then the effect ends."

As the balloon deflates, you descend gently toward the ground for up to 60 feet. If you are still in the air at the end of this distance, you fall if you have no other means of staying aloft.

It can be attached to a 10-foot pole to serve as a standard. Furling or unfurling the banner requires an action. The banner has the following properties. Mark of Courage: As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and cause it to emanate courage. You and your allies are immune to the frightened condition while within 20 feet of it. This benefit lasts for 10 minutes or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Sentinel Standard: You can see invisible creatures while they are within 20 feet of the unfurled banner and within your line of sight. Standard's Shield: As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and invoke this power. Any ranged attack roll that targets you or an ally of yours has disadvantage if the target is within 20 feet of the unfurled banner. This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Gift of Battle: You can transfer the banner's magic to a place by tracing the krig rune on the ground with your finger. The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 500-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the banner to be within 5 feet of you and during which you choose creatures, creature types, or both that will benefit from the magic. At the end, the banner is destroyed, and the area gains the following property: While in the 500-foot-radius sphere, the creatures you chose during the transfer process are immune to the frightened condition and gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and AC."

While wearing the crown, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet. Spells: The crown has 10 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (spell save 16): person (1 charge), disintegrate (6 charges), fear (3 charges), death (7 charges), stone (6 charges), person (2 charges), enfeeblement (2 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (3 charges), telekinesis (5 charges). The crown regains 3 expended charges daily at dawn. Symbiotic Nature: The crown can't be removed from you while you're attuned to it, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it. If you're targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the crown ends, and it detaches from you. The daelkyr ERLW made these crowns. While on the same plane of existence as the crown, Belashyrra can see through its eyestalks."

Force Sculpture: By focusing and channeling the bracelet's magic for 1 minute, you can create a spectral copy of a Large or smaller nonmagical object. The copy appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and it is made of tangible but translucent force that mimics the size, weight, and other properties of the object it's copying. The copy must appear on a surface or liquid that can support it. Creatures can touch and interact with the copy as if it were a nonmagical object. The copy is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled, but a disintegrate spell destroys it immediately. Otherwise, the copy disappears after 8 hours or when you dismiss it as an action. The bracelet can create up to three copies and regains all expended uses at dawn. Helpful Hand: As an action, you can use the bracelet to cast hand as a 9th-level spell (spell attack bonus +13). When you cast the spell this way, the spell doesn't require concentration. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties. Devour Soul: Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature and devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a wish spell. When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep Blackrazor in hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take 1d10 necrotic damage and the target regains 1d10 hit points. If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, Blackrazor devours your soul. Soul Hunter: While you hold the weapon. you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also can't be charmed or frightened. Blackrazor can cast the haste spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to. Sentience: Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every language you know. Personality: Blackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed. The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along. Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to Wave and Whelm, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with Whelm and finds Wave tedious. Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset."

    "Description": "The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see Personality below). This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls. The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 2 charges. Power Strike: When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target. Spells: While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: cold (5 charges), fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), invulnerability (6 charges), monster (5 charges), levitate (2 charges), bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), missile (1 charge), enfeeblement (1 charge), or force (5 charges). Retributive Strike: You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. You have a 50 chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Animate Walking Statues: You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see Personality below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken. Dispel Magic: You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell. Drain Magic: This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal. Master of Enchantment: When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot. Sentience: The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it. Personality: The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful. In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach. Spirit Trap: When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.) Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again."

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit. Random Properties: The sword has the following randomly determined properties, as described in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 major beneficial property 1 major detrimental property, which is suppressed while the sword is attuned to an archdevil Ruler of Avernus: As an action, you can point this sword at one devil you can see within 60 feet of you. That devil must succeed on a 22 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the devil follows your orders to the best of its ability. If you command the devil to do something it perceives as suicidal, the effect ends and you can no longer use this power of the sword against that devil. Infernal Recall: As an action, you can use the sword to cast recall. Creatures transported by this spell appear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the current ruler of Avernus, or a sanctuary you designate if you rule Avernus. Destroying the Sword: The sword can be destroyed by casting it into the River Styx or melting it down in the forge that created it."

Sentience: The Blade of Broken Mirrors is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 21, a Wisdom of 24, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common. Personality: An insane glabrezu named Ragazuu lives within the Blade of Broken Mirrors. The weapon yearns to cause chaos. It learns its wielder's principles, then uses those ideals to encourage reckless action. The dagger whispers ideas of revolution. Dormant: The dagger grants the following benefits in its dormant state: You can speak, read, and write Abyssal. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it returns to your hand. Whenever you kill a humanoid with an attack using the Blade of Broken Mirrors, the blade remembers the creature's appearance. While holding the dagger, you can use an action to change your form to match any humanoid the blade remembers. Your statistics, other than your size, don't change. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You can revert to your true appearance as an action. You revert to your true appearance automatically when you die. When the Blade of Broken Mirrors attunes to a new wielder, the appearances of humanoids it has killed are wiped from its memory. Betrayer Artifact Properties: The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See Artifact Properties in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information."

These cannon balls make up most of the weight of the ship's cargo. A winch mounted on the aft deck is used to load the cannon balls on board. A bombard can float and sail on water, but it can't land safely on the ground (its keel would cause it to roll on its side)."

    "Description": "The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil. The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose. A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind. Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book. Random Properties: The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties: 2 minor beneficial properties 2 major beneficial properties Increased Wisdom: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once. Enlightened Magic: Once you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher. Halo: Once you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage. Destroying the Book: It is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years."

    "Description": "The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness. Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs. Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined. Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough. A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within. Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil. The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned. Random Properties: The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties: 3 minor beneficial properties 1 major beneficial property 3 minor detrimental properties 2 major detrimental properties Adjusted Ability Scores: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again. Mark of Darkness: After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures. Command Evil: While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the monster spell on an evil target (save 18). You can't use this property again until the next dawn. Dark Lore: You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check. Dark Speech: While you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite words from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage. Destroying the Book: The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome. If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse. A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 100 years later. If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed."

Vile Speech: While the book is on your person, you can take a XPHB action to recite words from its pages in a foul, dead language. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 Psychic damage, and each creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 Psychic damage unless the creature is a Fiend or an Undead.

Anyone who talks with the transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily recognize that it is an artificial human. When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a veteran (human). If there isn't enough space for the veteran, the keyrune doesn't transform. The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed."

Expunge Imbalance: As a bonus action, you can expend 2 charges to cast the Restoration spell from the armor. The armor regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered."

The target must succeed on a 17 Charisma saving throw or have the bridle tie itself around its neck, then fall under your command as if subjected to the beast spell. Once the targeted is affected, you do not need to hold the other end of the bridle to command it. With a successful saving throw, the target becomes immune to the bridle's power until the next dawn. A creature controlled by the bridle can be released by the creature that bound it as a bonus action. A creature controlled by the bridle can make a 17 Charisma check each day at dawn.

The Calimemnon Crystal was made by high elf magic to imprison the notorious genie lords Calim and Memnon, who once ruled and warred over what is now Calimshan. When viewed by a creature with XPHB, the normally beautiful diamond is a grotesque sight: trapped within the gemstone are more than a hundred genies, including the physical forms of Calim and Memnon. The genies scream and strain in agonized fury, pressing their belligerent faces against the walls of their crystal line prison. Properties of the Crystal: While attuned to the crystal, you gain the following benefits: Arcane Focus: You can use the Calimemnon Crystal as an Arcane Focus. Flight: You have a XPHB of 30 feet and can hover. Spells: You can cast these spells with the crystal (spell save DC 18): XPHB, XPHB, XPHB (targeting yourself only), and XPHB. Aura of Cold: The temperature drops precipitously in a 20-foot Emanation originating from the crystal. Whenever the Emanation enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the Emanation or ends its turn there, the creature takes (2d6) Cold damage. A creature takes this damage only once per turn. While attuned to the crystal, you are unaffected by the aura, and you can take a XPHB action to disable or enable the aura. Healing/Damage Rays: While holding the crystal, you can take a XPHB action to fire six rays of volatile energy from the crystal at one or more creatures within 60 feet. You can aim the rays at one target or at several. For each ray, choose one of the following effects: Damage Ray: The target makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking (6) Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Healing Ray: The target regains 2 XPHB. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. Random Properties: The Artifact has the following random properties (see chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide): 1 minor beneficial property 1 major beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property 1 major detrimental property Destroying the Crystal: The Calimemnon Crystal is destroyed if the creature attuned to it casts the XPHB spell and wishes the crystal destroyed. Nothing else can harm it. When the crystal is destroyed, all the genies in the crystal are released."

After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time. While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot. Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the gate spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle."

Your travel time is reduced by half while you follow that route. If you succeed at the check by 5 or more, the map includes notes on the terrain, granting you advantage on the next ability check you make to travel through the mapped area in the next hour. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. Map of the Moment: Starting at rank 3, you can use an action to make a 15 Wisdom (Perception) check and search your cartographer's map case to find a map either related to your current mission or inspiring a new one. On a success, you find a map with a prominent landmark. The map has information on the natural terrain within one mile of the landmark.

If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew, which can provide one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew. The cauldron can create stew three times. It then ceases to function until the next dawn, when it regains all its uses."

A door to the room only exists when created using a demiplane spell, whether a chip of creation is used in the casting or not. Demiplane: While attuned to a chip of creation, you can cast demiplane at will but only to reach the demiplanar room associated with that chip of creation or another demiplane that you know the nature and contents of, and only if the target demiplane was created by another piece of the AitFR-AVT. Destroying a Chip: A chip of creation is an artifact in its own right and impervious to most damage, but a disintegrate spell is sufficient to destroy it. After it has been attuned once, a chip that has gone 1 days unattuned becomes an inert, powerless bit of rock. If the AitFR-AVT is destroyed, all its chips break attunement, lose all magical properties, and linked demiplanar rooms cease to exist at once. Creatures or objects within the room are instantly expelled into the immediate vicinity of the destroyed chip. If it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck by a forked, metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the shift spell), a chip is destroyed."

On a 1–3, you slow down time, gaining an additional action on your turn and doubling your speed until the end of the turn. On a 4–6, you go forward in time to warn yourself of what is to come. The next time you fail a saving throw, attack roll, or ability check, you can reroll the check and take either result. Once you use this feature of the chronolometer, it cannot be used again until the next dawn. Fate Swap: As a reaction when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, that creature gains an additional action if it is the creature's turn, or can take an action immediately even though it isn't the creature's turn. Once you use this feature of the chronolometer, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

Wyrmslayer: As an action, you can point the claw at a dragon within 30 feet of you. The dragon must then succeed on a 15 Constitution saving throw or gain vulnerability to all damage types until the end of your next turn. This property can be used three times. The claw regains all expended uses at the next dawn. Wyrm Shield: While the claw is displayed on your person, you have resistance to the damage caused by any dragon's breath weapon. Wyrm Ward: You can transfer the claw's magic to a place by tracing the wyrm rune on the ground with your finger.

Tattoo Attunement: To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space. Grasping Tendrils: While the tattoo is on your skin, you can, as an action, cause the tattoo to extrude into inky tendrils, which reach for a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a 14 Strength saving throw or take 3d6 force damage and be grappled by you. As an action, the creature can escape the grapple by succeeding on a 14 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The grapple also ends if you halt it (no action required), if the creature is ever more than 15 feet away from you, or if you use this tattoo on a different creature."

When you flip the coin, it always lands with the Acquisitions Incorporated sigil face down, and a message appears on the tails face. Roll a d4 on the following table to determine the message. The coin has absolutely no divination abilities, and its results when you use it are random. But nobody else knows that. When a creature within 10 feet of you flips the coin (after having had its powerful prognostication powers dutifully explained), you can exert your will to control its operation as a bonus action, choosing the result that appears after it lands as a means of gently coercing the user toward a specific course of action. The creature flipping the coin can detect your manipulation with a successful 13 Wisdom (Insight) check. Better Odds: When you reach rank 3, your coin of decisionry gains a measure of actual divination power and becomes an uncommon magic item. In addition to its normal function, you can use an action to flip the coin of decisionry twice while pondering a specific plan or objective, noting both random results. If you succeed on a 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, you learn which of the two results is more applicable to the course of action. This property of the coin can't be used again until the next dawn."

    "Description": "This painting by famed artist Dkesii Kwan depicts Constantori, a beautiful courtier, who was paid a staggering sum to be Dkesii's model. Whether Constantori's actual appearance matches the painting remains a subject of debate. The portrait is one of several paintings commissioned by the late Daiyani Grysthorn, a crime lord who frequently gave magical paintings as gifts to her most esteemed associates. Sentience: Constantori's Portrait is a sentient, lawful evil item with an Intelligence score of 14, a Wisdom score of 12, and a Charisma score of 8. It can hear within a range of 120 feet and has darkvision within a range of 60 feet, but it can't see anything behind itself. The painting can converse in Common, Draconic, and Elvish as if it were a living person, though Constantori's mouth doesn't move. Whenever conversation occurs within the portrait's auditory range, the painting eagerly gathers secrets, the names of secret tellers, significant events, or any political conversations. Personality: Constantori's Portrait is demanding, condescending, and vain. It doesn't like being covered or placed out of sight, and it loudly condemns anyone who tries to remove it from its gold-leaf frame. Wealth of Information: The painting's primary purpose is to observe and recall conversations. Over the past few decades, Constantori's Portrait has quietly observed countless conversations and now possesses an unquantifiable amount of lore—everything from criminal conspiracies to secret passwords. The DM decides what the painting knows and what it doesn't. While attuned to the painting, you can take an action to telepathically contact it over any distance, provided you and the painting are on the same plane of existence. The painting can't telepathically contact you, however. Maintaining telepathic contact with the painting requires your concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Guardian Portrait: While you are attuned to the painting, you can command it to guard its location against one or more creatures you identify as the painting's enemies. The painting performs this function until you command it to stop or until your attunement to the painting ends. The painting has 3 charges. When a creature the painting identifies as its enemy starts its turn in a space the painting can see, the painting expends 1 of its charges to cast missile (3 missiles), targeting that creature. The painting regains all expended charges daily at dawn. The painting is a Small object with AC 12, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison damage. In its gold-leaf frame, the painting weighs 15 pounds. If the painting has at least 1 hit point and is targeted by a mending spell, it regains 2d6 hit points."

    "Description": "Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

    "Description": "Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time. Random Properties: The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the Artifacts section of the DMG: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 major beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property Spells: The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: life (2 charges), purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), hope (1 charge), wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. Absolute Banishment: While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years. Failing Matrix: Whenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control. Iggwilv's Curse: When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss. Destroying or Repairing the Crook: The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property."

    "Description": "The Crown of Horns contains the essence and intelligence of Myrkul, one of the Dead Three. This ghastly crown is a pale silver circlet with four curved bones set around its rim. On the crown's brow is set a black diamond whose depths swirl with weird, malignant energy. Myrkul created the Crown of Horns at the height of his power. When Myrkul was slain by Mystra, he imbued the crown with his dying essence. Myrkul has since returned to become one of the Dead Three, and the Crown of Horns continues to further his gruesome will by seeking out mortal agents and gradually transforming them into powerful Undead scions. Should a wearer prove unworthy of this honor, the crown teleports away to find a new mortal to corrupt for its master. Cursed: The crown is cursed. Attuning to the crown extends the curse to you. Only a XPHB spell or the will of Myrkul can remove this curse. As long as you remain cursed, the following properties apply to you: Bound: You are unwilling to part with the crown, wearing it at all times, and you can't voluntarily end your XPHB to the crown. Cruel: Your alignment becomes Neutral Evil. Doomed: You slowly transform into a monstrous servant of Myrkul over the course of 365 days. During that time, the transformation is purely cosmetic; these cosmetic changes slowly fade if you end XPHB to the crown before completing the transformation. When the transformation is complete, you become a XMM under the DM's control. Each time you use this Artifact's Cone of Undeath or Myrkul's Hand benefit, there is a 10 percent cumulative chance that you instantly complete this transformation. Cone of Undeath: You can take a XPHB action to unleash a wave of unholy light in a 60-foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking (4d8) Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid killed by Cone of Undeath rises at the start of your next turn as a XMM that follows your verbal orders. Damage Immunity: You have XPHB to Necrotic damage. Fear Aura: While wearing the crown, you emit an aura of terrifying energy in a 60-foot Emanation. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or have the XPHB condition. A XPHB target must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from you, moving by the safest route. If you damage a XPHB target or if a XPHB target ends its turn more than 120 feet away from you, the target can repeat the Wisdom save, ending the condition on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on the save against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again. The aura is inactive while you have the XPHB condition. You can activate or deactivate the aura as a XPHB. Myrkul's Hand: While wearing the crown, you can cast the XPHB spell (save DC 18) from it. A Humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a XMM that follows your verbal orders. Once you use the crown to cast this spell, you can't cast it again from the crown until the next dawn. Teleportation: While wearing the crown, you can cast the XPHB spell. The crown can also cast this spell of its own free will. Once the spell has been cast using the crown, it can't be cast again until 7 days have passed. Random Properties: The Artifact has the following random properties (see chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide): 1 minor beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property 1 major detrimental property Sentience: The Crown of Horns is a sentient Neutral Evil Artifact with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and XPHB out to 120 feet. The crown communicates telepathically with its wearer and knows Common. Personality: The crown contains the essence of Myrkul and exists to spread that god's will, which is to slay the living, raise the dead, and sow fear across the Material Plane. The crown urges its wearer to spread dread and destruction wherever possible. Destroying the Crown: The crown is destroyed if it is worn by Myrkul's successor, Kelemvor, while he sits on the throne of Myrkul's former realm, the Bone Castle."

There, he languished as a vampire. In time, the Dark Powers of the Domain of Dread lured Kas to a hidden forge, where he found the Crown of Lies. Once Kas vowed to deliver Vecna into the Dark Powers' clutches and donned the crown, the Dark Powers released Kas. From there, Kas set out to ruin his former master. Should Kas fail, the Dark Powers will reclaim him. The crown is made of burnished and entwined metal rods. To attune to it, you must place it on your head and speak a true desire of your heart. You know how to attune to the crown when you touch it. Random Properties: The Crown of Lies has the following random properties (see the DMG for options): 1 minor beneficial property 1 major beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property Perfect Disguise: While attuned to the crown, you can use an action to transform yourself to look and feel like any creature you've seen at least once and whose size is no more than one size smaller or larger than yours. The new form mimics the chosen creature's appearance exactly, including its voice. Your size and speed are replaced by the chosen creature's. You otherwise retain your own game statistics. While in this new form, the crown melds into your person and is undetectable. Your new form lasts until you die, your attunement to the crown ends, or you use another action to transform into a different creature or your true form. Interactions with you while you are transformed by the crown reveal no illusory magic, nor do they reveal anything other than details about the creature you're disguised as. You count as the chosen creature for the purposes of spells, traps, and other defenses that wouldn't target the chosen creature. While in your disguised form, any lies you tell always seem to be true, no matter what magical or mundane methods are used to try to detect your falsehoods. You are the recipient of Sending spells addressed to you and the creature you are disguised as, and Scrying and similar spells that target the creature you are disguised as actually target you. The only way to reveal your true nature while transformed by the crown is with a Wish spell. While wearing this crown in your true form, you can choose for the crown to be visible if you wish. Destroying the Crown: If a creature wearing the crown is killed by the creature it is disguised as, the crown disintegrates and is destroyed."

A sliding hatch just behind the wings allows access to the ship's mangonel turret. The ship's cargo hold can easily be turned into crew cabins or another weapon deck. Damselfly ships are often used as courier vessels and armored transports. Explorers and pirates like them because they're fast and sturdy. Military leaders use them as command ships for the same reasons. Damselfly ship owners are a proud lot, fond of painting their ships in colorful patterns as well as customizing their vessels with special equipment. Large, private gatherings of damselfly ship owners are not uncommon; they use these get-togethers to show off their ships and to race one another through asteroid belts and other obstacle courses, either for rewards or bragging rights."

    "Description": "This artifact destroys wealth to provide light and protection. Wrought from the finest yellow gold, the lantern has four faces, and an unwavering amber flame burns within it. The faces of the lantern are fitted with faceted gemstone lenses. The lantern is a symbol of the teachings of Daoud, who was once a priest of Istus, a god of fate. When Daoud was stripped of his possessions, he developed a radical new philosophy in his quest to understand fate. He urged followers of his ideology to eschew wealth and seek out all fortunes, good and ill, to unravel the cloth of destiny. Random Properties: The lantern has the following random properties: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 major beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property Precious Fuel: The lantern burns only one source of fuel: powdered gemstones placed in the lantern's base. The lantern can hold a maximum of 10,000 gp worth of powdered gems, and it contains 9,000 gp of fuel when found. Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out. You can add more fuel to the lantern as part of a short or long rest. Once added, fuel can't be removed from the lantern's base. The lantern's flame can't be extinguished by any means other than running out of fuel. If the lantern's flame goes out, the creature attuned to it immediately dies. One exception to this rule exists (see the Destroying the Lantern section). Revealing Light: The lantern sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible while in the lantern's bright light. While attuned to the lantern, you can use a bonus action to dim the lantern, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius, or brighten the lantern back to its normal bright light radius. Lenses: When found, the lantern's faces display the following gem lenses: diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. As part of a short or long rest, you can magically change any of these gem lenses to a different type of gem shown in the Lenses table. The gem lenses can't be removed from the lantern. As an action while holding the lantern, you can burn some of the lantern's fuel to cast a spell (save 20) through one or more of its current gem lenses, as noted in the Lenses table. The spell's target or point of origin must be in the lantern's area of bright light. If there isn't enough fuel left to cast the spell, the last of the remaining fuel is expended, and the flame goes out. Destroying the Lantern: To destroy the lantern, the creature attuned to it must forsake all material possessions except for the lantern and common clothes. Then the creature must willingly snuff the lantern's flame with the intention to destroy the artifact. When its flame is snuffed in this way, the lantern's gold corrodes, the lenses and remaining gemstone fuel turn to worthless sand, and the creature attuned to it is spared."

While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with Dawnbringer. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. While holding the weapon, you can use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast restoration on that creature. Once used, this ability can't be used again until the next dawn. Sentience: Dawnbringer is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while attuned to it. Personality: Forged by ancient sun worshippers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies. Long years lost in darkness have made Dawnbringer frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time."

    "Description": "Over the centuries since the first Deck of Many Things was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it. But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things. (More information on creating new cards for this deck appears in chapter 2.) Like the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect. As soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously. Unless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times. The DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn. Aberration: You gain telepathy within a range of 90 feet. Beast: You immediately transform into a type=beast. Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast's game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you're wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can't be used. Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form. You remain transformed in this way for 2d12 days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the Wish spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed. Book: You gain the ability to speak, read, and write 2 languages of your choice. Bridge: You gain the ability to cast the Stop spell 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Campfire: You immediately gain the benefits of finishing a long rest. Cavern: You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain the ability to move up, down, across vertical surfaces, and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. Celestial: You sprout a pair of softly luminescent, feathered wings from your back and gain a flying speed of 30 feet. Construct: A homunculus appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator. Corpse: You immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the unconscious condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the Wish spell. Crossroads: Roll a d20. If the roll is even, you age 1d10 years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by 1d10 years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic. Door: You gain the ability to cast the Gate spell 1d4 times, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Dragon: A dragon egg appears at your feet and immediately hatches into a dragon wyrmling. The type of dragon is chosen by the DM. The wyrmling views you as its parent and is staunchly loyal to you and your allies. Elemental: You become immune to one of the following damage types (choose immediately upon drawing this card): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Expert: Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. Fey: A fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you're immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards. The fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM. Fiend: A powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane. Giant: You immediately grow 2d10 inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20. Humanoid: You can immediately choose to stop drawing from the deck, regardless of how many cards you initially declared. Lance: All your ability scores increase by 1, to a maximum of 20. Mage: Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. Map: At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can mentally name or describe an object or individual that is familiar to you. You immediately know the location of the object or individual, as well as the distance between you and the object or individual, even if the object or individual is on a different plane of existence. If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining. Maze: You gain 1d3 levels of exhaustion. Mine: A pile of 2d6 gems (each worth 5,000 gp) and 1d10 chunks of precious ore (each worth 2,500 gp) appears at your feet. Monstrosity: A size=l;h;g (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. The creature is hostile toward you and attacks immediately. The creature disappears when it is killed or when you are reduced to 0 hit points. If there isn't enough space for a Large or larger creature to appear, this card has no effect. Ooze: A cube immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn't enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect. Path: Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. Pit: A pit opens beneath you. You plummet 10 feet, take damage from the fall, and have the prone condition. Plant: You gain the ability to cast Plants without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. If you have spell slots of 3rd level or higher, you can cast this spell using them. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Priest: Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. Prisoner: Glowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the restrained condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the Magic spell or similar magic. However, a Disintegrate spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a 30 Dexterity check using PHB. Ring: A category= appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring. Shield: A category= that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor. Ship: You gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM. Staff: A category= appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item. Stairway: You can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a category=, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item. Statue: You immediately have the petrified condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the Restoration spell or similar magic. Tavern: Your Charisma score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22. Temple: A deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the Resurrection spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you. Tomb: At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the Resurrection spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Tower: Draw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter. Tree: Your skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic. Undead: Somewhere on the Material Plane, a revenant rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a Wish spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife. Warrior: Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22. Well: You learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list."

But this doesn't have to be true; you can give each card a property as a standalone item, so characters who find only one card can still enjoy this famed item and use the card on adventures. This approach is particularly useful if you make a Things the object of a quest; as the characters explore, each card they find grants them a magical ability they can use in subsequent adventures to find the cards that remain. Eventually the heroes assemble the entire deck, which they can then use in the traditional manner, drawing transformative cards from it in a fitting climax to the campaign. cards: BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT BMT"

    "Description": "Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once. Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Deck of Many Things or the Deck of Many Things, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. A Question of Enmity: Two of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil itself. In the case of the Deck of Many Things card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer. Vizier: At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it. Sun: You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands. Moon: You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times. Star: Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24. Comet: If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect. The Fates: Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die. Throne: You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours. Key: A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon. Knight: You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character. Gem: Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet. Talons: Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish. The Void: This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards. Flames: A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies. Skull: You summon an DMG—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own DMG. A creature slain by an DMG can't be restored to life. Idiot: Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. Donjon: You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards. Ruin: All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. Euryale: The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of Deck of Many Things card can end this curse. Rogue: A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you. Balance: Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you. Fool: You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level. Jester: You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws."

    "Description": "Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column of the Deck of Many Things table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw.

Unless the card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.) Each card's effect is described below. Balance: You can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You can't decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect. Comet: The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll XPHB. If you reduce your foe to 0 XPHB during that combat, you have XPHB on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 XPHB or you don't choose a foe, this card has no effect. Donjon: You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you're wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any Divination magic, but a XPHB spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards. Euryale: The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse. Fates: Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die. Flames: A powerful devil becomes your enemy.

As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer. Fool: You have XPHB on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn't count as one of your declared draws. Gem: Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet. Jester: You have XPHB on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. Key: A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon. Knight: You gain the service of a XMM, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired. Moon: You gain the ability to cast XPHB 1d3 times. Puzzle: Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. Rogue: An NPC of the DM's choice becomes Hostile toward you. You don't know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a XPHB spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you. Ruin: All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see the 7), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears. Sage: At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Skull: An XDMG appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 XPHB or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar can't be restored to life. Star: Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24. Sun: A magic item (chosen by the DM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 XPHB daily at dawn until you die. Talons: Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead. Throne: You gain proficiency and XPHB in your choice of XPHB, XPHB, XPHB, or XPHB. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours. Void: Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A XPHB spell can't return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards."

Balance: Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change for the duration of the adventure. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you. Comet: If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you have advantage on ability checks made using one skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure. Otherwise, this card has no effect. Donjon: You are instantly teleported to and confined within the prison of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M6). Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You draw no more cards. Euryale: The card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −1 penalty on saving throws for the duration of the adventure. The Fates: Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other point during the adventure. Flames: The Grand Master of the Monastery of the Distressed Body becomes your enemy. The bone devil seeks your ruin, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. If the Grand Master has already been defeated, you gain the enmity of Garret Levistusson's patron—a similarly powerful devil. Fool: For the duration of the adventure, you lose proficiency with one skill or gain disadvantage on all checks made with one skill (with the skill and the penalty determined by the DM). Discard this card and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. Gem: The 1,000 gp hoard of the leprechaun from the Wilderness Encounters table (see appendix A) appears at your feet. If that treasure has already been claimed, you gain an equivalent hoard. Idiot: Reduce your Intelligence by 1 (to a minimum score of 1) for the duration of the adventure. You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws. Jester: You gain proficiency in a skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. Key: A common or uncommon magic weapon with which you are proficient, or a scroll featuring a spell of a level you can cast, appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon or spell, which you possess for the duration of this adventure. Knight: You gain the service of any of the NPCs in the services section not currently with the party, who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The NPC serves you loyally for the duration of the adventure, believing that the fates have drawn them to you. You control this character. Moon: You are granted the ability to cast any spell of 5th level or lower, and can use that ability 1d3 times for the duration of the adventure. Rogue: An NPC of the DM's choice becomes secretly hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Any enchantment spell cast on the NPC at 6th level or higher can end the NPC's hostility toward you. Ruin: All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. This wealth can be recovered either in the treasury of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M10) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure. Skull: You summon an avatar of death—a mechanical skeleton (use bone naga statistics) clad in a tattered black robe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can't be restored to life. Star: Increase one of your ability scores by 1 for the duration of the adventure. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24. Sun: You gain proficiency in the skill of your choice for the duration of the adventure. In addition, a common or uncommon wondrous item appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item, which you possess for the duration of this adventure. Talons: Every magic item you wear or carry is lost to you. These items can be recovered either in the treasury of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M10) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure. Throne: You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill for the duration of the adventure. In addition, the Monastery of the Distressed Body's brains in jars regard you thereafter as the monastery's rightful master. You must defeat or otherwise clear out the Grand Master and its servants before you can claim the monastery as yours. Vizier: At any one time you choose within the duration of the adventure, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it. The Void: This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and held within machinery in either the control room of the Monastery of the Distressed Body (area M8) or Kwalish's lab in Daoine Gloine (area O7), whichever comes later in the adventure. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. Divination, plane, or a similar spell of 4th level or higher reveals the location of the machinery that holds your soul. You draw no more cards. Using the Deck of Several Things: The special nature of this deck (carried by LLK if she is used as an NPC) means that many of its effects operate only within and with respect to this specific adventure. This typically covers any time the characters spend between setting out for the Barrier Peaks and the resolution of whatever events transpire in Kwalish's lab (area O7). For cards that effectively remove a character from play for a period of time (LLK and LLK), you can allow a player to take on the role of one of the party's NPC hirelings, or introduce a temporary character as an NPC met during the party's journey. Alternatively, you can decide that only some aspect of the character's will disappears and is imprisoned, leaving the character to operate in a robotic state until freed."

    "Description": "Created in the image of the Deck of Many Things, this deck of ivory or vellum cards bestows an assortment of minor benefits and penalties on those who draw from it. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two. Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw, then draw them randomly. Any additional cards drawn have no effect. Unless a card states otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously. Unless it is the Mystery card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times. You can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck, as shown in the Deck of Wonder table. Beginning: Your hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 2d10. Your hit point maximum remains increased in this way for the next 8 hours. Champion: You gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack and damage rolls. This bonus lasts for 8 hours. Chancellor: Within 8 hours of drawing this card, you can cast Augury once as an action, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Chaos: You gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days. Coin: Five pieces of jewelry, each worth 100 gp, or ten gemstones, each worth 50 gp, appear at your feet. Crown: You learn the Friends cantrip. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). If you already know this cantrip, the card has no effect. Dawn: This card invigorates you. For the next 8 hours, you can add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls. Day: You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws. This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest. Destiny: This card protects you against an untimely demise. The first time after drawing this card that you would drop to 0 hit points from taking damage, you instead drop to 1 hit point. Dusk: This card supernaturally saps your energy. You have disadvantage on initiative rolls. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a Curse spell or similar magic. End: This card is an omen of death. You take 2d10 necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This effect can't reduce your hit point maximum below 10 hit points. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a Curse spell or similar magic. Isolation: You disappear, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, and become trapped in a harmless extradimensional space for 1d4 minutes. You draw no more cards. You then reappear in the space you left or the nearest unoccupied space. When you reappear, you must succeed on a 11 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hour as your body reels from the extradimensional travel. Justice: You momentarily gain the ability to balance the scales of fate. For the next 8 hours, whenever you or a creature within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage. Knife: An uncommon magic weapon you're proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon. Lock: You gain the ability to cast Knock 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Mischief: You receive an uncommon wondrous item (chosen by the DM), or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws. Monster: This card's monstrous visage curses you. While cursed in this way, whenever you make a saving throw, you must roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from the total. The curse lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early with a Curse spell or similar magic. Mystery: You have disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws for 1 hour. Discard this card and draw from the deck again; together, the two draws count as one of your declared draws. Night: You gain darkvision within a range of 300 feet. This darkvision lasts for 8 hours. Order: You gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): force, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days. Student: You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice). Vulture: One nonmagical item or piece of equipment in your possession (chosen by the DM) disappears. The item remains nearby but concealed for a short time, so it can be found with a successful 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. If the item isn't recovered within 1 hour, it disappears forever."

    "Description": "Thassa wields Dekella, a two-pronged weapon gifted to her by Purphoros. When the god of the sea bestows her weapon on a mortal, it's often so they might work her will far from the ocean, right some wrong affecting those she'd prefer not to harm, or give a mortal a glimpse of her terrible responsibilities. Bident of the Deep: Thassa's signature weapon thrums with the icy currents of the deep ocean. This weapon functions as a trident that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using the bident, the target takes an extra 2d10 cold damage. Blessing of the Deep: If you are a worshiper of Thassa, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:  If you aren't a worshiper of Thassa, the bident has 1 minor detrimental property and 1 major detrimental property, both randomly determined. See Artifacts in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties. Command the Deep: The bident holds the power to command the waves and its creatures. As an action, you can change the condition of the sea within 1 mile of you, creating strong winds and heavy rain that cause violent waves (see Weather at Sea in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) or calming a storm. In either case, the unnatural weather lasts for 1 hour before returning to normal. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk. Additionally, you can cast the monster spell (save 18) from the bident, but only on beasts and monstrosities that have an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk. Aquatic Metamorphosis: You can cast the polymorph spell (save 18) from the bident, but you must cast it on a creature to turn it into a kind of creature that has an innate swimming speed. Once used, this property of the bident can't be used again until the next dusk. Destroying the Bident: To destroy the bident, it must be heated by the breath of an dragon and then, while still hot, immersed in the Tartyx River."

While attuned to the glove, you gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed and blindsight to 15 feet.

    "Description": "An expansive treatise documenting the Abyss's infinite layers and inhabitants, the Demonomicon of Iggwilv is the most thorough and blasphemous tome of demonology in the multiverse. The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material. Random Properties: The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the Artifacts section of the DMG: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 minor detrimental property 1 major detrimental property Spells: The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast laughter from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save 20) from it: circle (1 charge), jar (3 charges), ally (3 charges), binding (2 charges), shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), TCE (3 charges). Abyssal Reference: You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check. Fiendish Scourging: Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling. Ensnarement: While carrying the book, whenever you cast the circle spell naming only fiends, or the binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell. Containment: The first 10 pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a circle. The fiend must succeed on a 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon's empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn. When you finish a long rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days. When the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons. Destroying the Demonomicon: To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the Zyx, the work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu instantly knows."

Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material. Abyssal Lore: You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (XPHB) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you gain XPHB on the check. Containment: The first ten pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As a XPHB action while holding the book, you can target a Fiend that you can see that is trapped within the area of a XPHB spell. The Fiend must succeed on a 20 Charisma saving throw with XPHB or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon's blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn. When you finish a XPHB, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, one trapped creature within the book can attempt to possess you. You make a 20 Charisma saving throw.

Fiendish Scourging: While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a Fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling. Random Properties: The Artifact has the following random properties: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 minor detrimental property 1 major detrimental property Spells: The book has 8 charges and regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the book, you can take a XPHB action to cast one of the spells (save 20) on the following table. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Destroying the Demonomicon: To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book.

The Tome of Zyx can be destroyed like any ordinary book. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu knows instantly."

    "Description": "A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed. A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates 1d100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as identify and divination can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly. A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb's opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes 1d6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container. Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere's point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use. Air Orb: When this orb detonates, it creates a powerful windstorm that lasts for 1 hour. Whenever a creature ends its turn exposed to the wind, the creature must succeed on a 18 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage, as the wind and debris batter it. The wind is strong enough to uproot weak trees and destroy light structures after at least 10 minutes of exposure. Otherwise, the rules for wind apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide."

During that time, it pursues only a single mission you give it—usually an assignment to take over someone's body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission is complete, the creature returns to you, reports its success, and reverts to its keyrune form. When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a devourer. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed."

It was once the horn of her dragon consort, Ephelomon, that she gave to dragonkind to help them in their war against the giants. The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire. The low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages. Those with knowledge of the Draakhorn's history know that it was first built to signal danger to chromatic dragons—a purpose the Cult of the Dragon has corrupted to call chromatic dragons to the Well of Dragons from across the North. Within 50 feet of any enclosed space where the horn is blown, the air begins to shimmer from the sound. Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the enclosed space must succeed on a 12 Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry. For any character entering the enclosed space, the sound fades to silence—because any creature that enters the enclosed space is temporarily deafened and must make a 12 Constitution saving throw. Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. While the horn is sounding, a creature must make a 15 Constitution saving throw the first time on a turn the creature enters a 150-foot cone in front of the horn or starts its turn there. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone."

Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of dreamlily is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the duration or the price might vary accordingly."

    "Description": "Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions.

Nylea is quick to let her favored followers borrow her bow, particularly when they intend to use it to perform great deeds, put an end to foul creatures, or cast down the arrogant. Bow of the Wild: This divine weapon includes a shortbow and a quiver with four arrows, each tied to one of the four seasons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this bow, and you suffer no disadvantage when attacking at the weapon's long range. Additionally, Ephixis scores a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20. Blessing of the Wild: If you are a worshiper of Nylea, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:  If you aren't a worshiper of Nylea, the bow has 1 randomly determined major detrimental property. See Artifacts in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties. Arrows of the Seasons: The four arrows—each associated with a season—that accompany this bow can be fired only from it. Each arrow disappears immediately after it's used, and it reappears in the quiver at the next dusk. The save DC against spells cast with the arrows is 18. Each arrow has a unique property: Spring: As an action, you can fire this arrow, targeting a beast or a plant creature you can see within 320 feet of you. On a hit, the arrow deals no damage, and the target gains the benefits of the awaken spell for 8 hours. Summer: As an action, you can fire this arrow at an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required. A Nyxborn lynx is summoned in that space (use the stat block for a tiger with the Nyxborn Creatures from chapter 6). The lynx understands your verbal commands and obeys them as best it can, and it takes its turns immediately after yours. The emissary remains for 1 hour before fading away. Autumn: As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space on the ground that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the thorns spell there. Winter: As an action, you can fire this arrow at a space that you can see within 320 feet of you, no attack roll required, casting the storm spell there. Destroying the Bow: The bow can't be destroyed without first destroying all its arrows. The winter arrow must be fed to a cerberus on the winter solstice. The spring arrow must be planted at the base of a Black Oak of Asphodel on the spring equinox. The summer arrow must be broken by a sea giant on the summer solstice. Then the autumn arrow must be shot into the carcass of a hydra on the autumnal equinox. When all four arrows are destroyed, the bow and quiver dissolve into dust."

    "Description": "Seldom is the name of Vecna spoken except in a hushed voice. Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about. MTF, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower. Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world. The Eye of Vecna and the Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity. To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die. To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die. Random Properties: The Eye of Vecna and the Vecna each have the following random properties: 1 minor beneficial property 1 major beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property Properties of the Eye: Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits: You have truesight. You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a vision. You can end this effect as a bonus action. The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control. Properties of the Eye and Hand: If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits: You are immune to disease and poison. Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion. You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised. If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points. If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. You can use an action to cast wish. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed. Destroying the Eye and Hand: If the Eye of Vecna and the Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered."

To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through themselves. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead. Destroying the Eye and Hand: If the Eye of Vecna and the XDMG are both attached to the same creature and that creature is slain by the XDMG, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed.

The diatryma uses the statistics of an beak, except that its beak deals piercing damage instead of slashing damage. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it can be used as a mount. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the diatryma defends itself but takes no other actions."

You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

    "Description": "This magic flail is made in the image of Tiamat, with five jagged heads shaped like the heads of five different chromatic dragons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this flail. When you hit with an attack roll using it, the target takes an extra 5d4 damage of your choice of one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. While holding the flail, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause the heads to breathe multicolored flames in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 damage of one of the following damage types (your choice): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."

On each of your turns, you can issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you), and as long as you are holding this card, the devil obeys your commands. Otherwise, it is under the DM's control and acts according to its nature—it might attack you if it thinks it can prevail or try to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for further service.

The chair has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points. The sensation of being attuned to a flying citadel helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as intense. While attuned to a flying citadel helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell): You can use the flying citadel helm to move the citadel through the air, up to 80 feet per round, or up to 8 miles per hour. You can steer the citadel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship. At any time, you can see and hear from the highest point outside the citadel as though you were at that location. If no creature attuned to the helm is maintaining concentration, the citadel remains motionless in its space. Transfer Attunement: You can use an action or a bonus action to touch a willing spellcaster, whereupon that creature attunes to the flying citadel helm immediately, and your attunement to the flying citadel helm ends. Crash: Should the flying citadel helm be destroyed, the citadel it is installed on loses power and begins to crumble. If the crumbling citadel is in the air, it descends at a rate of 30 feet per round, or 300 feet per minute. Any creature on the citadel or on the ground within 120 feet of the citadel when it lands must make a 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 39 (6d12) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

While you hold the pipe, you can expend charges to gain access to the following properties: You can cast cloud as an action (1 charge). You can cast step as a bonus action (2 charges). You can summon a mephit as an action (3 charges). The mephit is friendly to you, obeys your verbal commands, and acts on its own turn in the initiative order. It disappears in a harmless puff of steam after 1 minute or if it ends its turn more than 60 feet from the pipe."

Among giants, this item is used as part of rituals to resolve disputes. The gavel has the following properties. Arbiters Shield: At the start of every combat, attack rolls against you have disadvantage before the start of your first turn, provided that the gavel is on your person. Bond of Amity: As an action, you can use the gavel to strike a point on a hard surface. The first time in the next minute that a creature within 60 feet of that point deals damage to another creature with an attack that hits, the attacker takes psychic damage equal to half the damage it dealt to the target. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Gift of Truth: You can transfer the gavel's magic to a place by tracing the venn rune on the ground with your finger. The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 30-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the gavel to be within 5 feet of you. At the end, the gavel is destroyed, and the area gains the following property: Whenever a creature utters a lie while within the 30-foot-radius sphere, that creature takes 5 psychic damage and flinches visibly."

This magical paint bestows temporary magical gifts on creatures with runes drawn on their skin with this paint. One paint pot contains enough pigment to paint one rune. A creature can spend 10 minutes to paint one of the following runes onto itself or another creature: Journey Rune: 3 doesn't cost the painted creature extra movement. Life Rune: The painted creature gains 10 temporary hit points and has advantage on death saving throws. Light Rune: The painted creature gains darkvision to a range of 30 feet. If the painted creature already has darkvision from another source, the range of its darkvision increases by 30 feet. Mountain Rune: The painted creature is immune to being knocked prone and has advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. Shield Rune: The painted creature has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that deal damage. A creature can benefit from only one painted rune at a time, so a new rune painted on a creature has no effect unless the old one is removed first. The rune's benefits last for 8 hours or until the painted creature uses its action to wipe away the rune."

The metals are all different colors, making the grenade shine with a rainbow of color when held up in the light. As a bonus action, a creature can turn a special key to arm the grenade. Once armed, the grenade explodes in a matter of seconds. As an action, the wielder can hurl the grenade up to 120 feet. At the end of their turn, the grenade explodes. All creatures within 60 feet of the grenade when it explodes suffer the following effects: Each creature must make a 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much fire damage on a successful one. Each creature must make a 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 28 (8d6) thunder damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much thunder damage and is not stunned. The wielder rolls on the chart* for the dmg three times, rerolling any duplicate results. Any effects that specify a target affect all creatures in range of the grenade when it explodes. Any effects that would affect the wielder of the wand instead affect the closest creature to the grenade when it goes off. The grenade explodes immediately if a creature places it in an extradimensional space or teleports while in possession of it. The effects of the explosion will be felt at both the origin and terminus of the teleportation, but only affecting all creatures within 30 feet of either location."

    "Description": "Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

If there isn't enough space for the creature where it would appear, the figurine doesn't become a creature. The two forms are as follows: Giant Canary Form: The figurine becomes a FTD for up to 8 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once the figurine has become a FTD, it can't be used this way again until the next dawn. Gold Dragon Form: While you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an dragon (see its stat block in the Monster Manual) for up to 1 hour. The dragon can't use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an dragon, it can't be used this way again until 1 year has passed. In either form, the creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. The creature exists for a duration specific to each form. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the description."

The scorpion has an Intelligence of 4 and can communicate with you telepathically while it is within 60 feet of you, though its messages are largely limited to describing the passage of potential prey. When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a scorpion. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed."

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Infernal. Personality: A covetous ultroloth named Ciria lives within Grovelthrash. The weapon values material possessions and doling out pain. It compliments its wielder whenever they claim treasure and takes pleasure in harming others. Dormant: The warhammer grants the following benefits in its dormant state: You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this warhammer, you can deal an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage to the target. If you do, you take 1d6 psychic damage. The warhammer deals double damage to objects and structures. While holding this weapon, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to discern a lie spoken in a language you understand. Betrayer Artifact Properties: The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See Artifact Properties in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information."

When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed."

If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die. Vampiric Strike: The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a 12 Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with short term madness (see DMG in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower. Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world. The Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity. To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die. To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die. Random Properties: The Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties: 1 minor beneficial property 1 major beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property Properties of the Hand: Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits: Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher. Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit. The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: death (5 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (2 charges), or teleport (3 charges). The hand regains 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you. Properties of the Eye and Hand: If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits: You are immune to disease and poison. Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion. You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised. If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points. If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. You can use an action to cast wish. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed. Destroying the Eye and Hand: If the Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered."

When a creature comes within 5 feet of the harp, the instrument animates and is capable of speaking, singing, and playing by itself. Whenever you attempt to attune to the harp, you must first make either a 15 Charisma (Performance) check or a 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the harp that you are worthy, attuning to the harp on a success. If you fail, you can't attempt to attune to the harp again until the next dawn. Once you have successfully attuned to the harp, the harp resizes to suit you. Stalwart Song: Whenever you make a Charisma check while attuned to the harp, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the die as a 10. Feast of Plenty: If you spend 10 minutes playing the harp, you can cast the feast spell from it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until 10 days have passed. Soothing Melody: As an action, you can use the harp to cast the emotions spell (save 19). When the spell is cast using the harp, its duration increases to 1 hour, provided you maintain concentration on the spell. This property can be used five times, and it regains all uses at dawn. Sentience: The harp is a sentient, chaotic good object with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet. The harp can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant. It can also communicate telepathically with the creature attuned to it. The harp has a dramatic and pompous personality, taking extreme pride in the quality of music produced from its strings. If the harp is shorter than 6 feet tall, it bemoans its height."

    "Description": "This dark cloak is made of cured hound hide. As an action, you can command the cloak to transform you into a hound for up to 1 hour. The transformation otherwise functions as the polymorph spell, but you can use a bonus action to revert to your normal form. Curse: This cloak is cursed with the essence of a hound, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with curse or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the cloak, keeping it within reach at all times. The sixth time you use the cloak, and each time thereafter, you must make a 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the transformation lasts until dispelled or until you drop to 0 hit points, and you can't willingly return to normal form. If you ever remain in hound form for 6 hours, the transformation becomes permanent and you lose your sense of self. All your statistics are then replaced by those of a hound. Thereafter, only curse or similar magic allows you to regain your identity and return to normal. If you remain in this permanent form for 6 days, only a wish spell can reverse the transformation."

When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic. You gain the following benefits while wearing it: You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a component: daylight (opal), fireball (fire opal), spray (diamond), or fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm. As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage. As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage. As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon. Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm.

You can telepathically communicate with a devil within range, or you can broadcast your thoughts to all devils within range. The devils receiving your broadcasted thoughts have no special means of replying to them. The helm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast monster (save 21), which affects devils only. (The spell fails and the charge is wasted if you target any creature that's not a devil.) If a devil can see you when you cast this spell on it, the devil knows you tried to charm it. The helm regains all its charges 24 hours after its last charge is expended. If you are not a devil, using the helm's monster property in the Nine Hells has a 20 chance of attracting a MTF, which arrives on the back of a nightmare mount in 1d4 hours. The narzugon tries to recover the helm, killing you if necessary to obtain it. If it gets the helm, the narzugon tries to deliver it to its infernal master."

Artifacts are unaffected by this property, as are magic items on your person.

    "Description": "This ornate chair is designed to propel and maneuver a ship through space. Passive Properties: The following properties of the helm come into play even when no creature is attuned to it: When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an envelope of fresh air around the ship while it is in the void of space (but not underwater). This envelope extends out from the edges of the hull in all directions for a distance equal in length to the vessel's beam, so that creatures aboard and near the ship can breathe normally in space. The temperature within the air envelope is 70 degrees Fahrenheit. When placed aboard a vessel weighing between 1 and 100 tons, the helm generates an artificial gravity field while the ship is in the void of space, so that creatures can walk on the ship's decks as they normally would. Creatures and objects that fall overboard bob in a gravity plane that extends out from the main deck for a distance equal in length to the vessel's beam. Active Properties: The sensation of being attuned to the helm is akin to being immersed in warm water. While attuned to the helm, you gain the following abilities while you sit in it: You can use the helm to propel the vessel across or through water and other liquids at a maximum speed in miles per hour equal to your highest-level unexpended spell slot. You can use the helm to propel the vessel through air or space at a maximum speed in miles per hour equal to your highest-level unexpended spell slot × 10. Provided you have at least one unexpended spell slot, you can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the same way that oars or a rudder can maneuver a seafaring ship. Whenever you like, you can see what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it. Drawback: While attuned to the helm, you cannot expend your own spell slots."

The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is soft and deep but rises in a wild furor when it's aware Celestials or worshipers of good-aligned deities are present. While you are attuned to it, Heretic also understands every language you know. Personality: Heretic craves the destruction of good-aligned gods and their supporters. The blade is condescending and snobby, especially in the company of priests and other pious folk, at whom it often directs sneering comments. When Heretic identifies its quarry, it erupts in a frenzied need for violence."

Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents. Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top. The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a holding, hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened."

Each portal is a two-dimensional, glowing oval ring, and together they create an open doorway up to 6 feet high and 4 feet wide. Any creature or object entering one portal exits from the other as if the two portals were a single opening that connects their locations. A portal can appear on a moving surface, but the effect ends when the two portals move more than 1 mile apart. As a bonus action while holding the staff, you can close both portals (ending the effect) or suppress one portal, causing it to disappear until you relocate it (see above), during which time the remaining portal can't be used.

Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana's passing. The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center. The holy symbol has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 4 charges daily at dawn. Hold Vampires: As an action, you can expend 1 charge and present the holy symbol to make it flare with holy power. Vampires and spawn within 30 feet of the holy symbol when it flares must make a 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target is paralyzed for 1 minute. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end the effect on itself. Turn Undead: If you have the Turn Undead or the Turn the Unholy feature, you can expend 3 charges when you present the holy symbol while using that feature. When you do so, undead have disadvantage on their saving throws against the effect. Sunlight: As an action, you can expend 5 charges while presenting the holy symbol to make it shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight and lasts for 10 minutes or until you end the effect (no action required)."

    "Description": "Iggwilv crafted this wondrous cauldron with the help of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid. Attunement: Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature. Three hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags. Random Properties: Regardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties: 1 minor beneficial property (determined by rolling on the Minor Beneficial Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide) 1 minor detrimental property (determined by rolling on the Minor Detrimental Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide) Gold Cauldron: The gold cauldron has the following properties: If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew. If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn. When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a scrying spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes. Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a broom of flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn. Iron Cauldron: The iron cauldron has the following properties: You can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a bats that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn. If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn. Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a polymorph with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days. If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called The Witch Queen's Cauldron (see the accompanying sidebar), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting The Witch Queen's Cauldron ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn. Destroying the Cauldron: The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic. The destruction of Iggwilv's Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the Hag Covens sidebar in the Monster Manual). Reconstructing the Cauldron: If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron's reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse. The Witch Queen's Cauldron: As explained in the description of Iggwilv's Cauldron, the poem titled The Witch Queen's Cauldron is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact: Eight cats perch atop eight dead attending Eight lizards flee from eight rats scavenging Eight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling Eight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming Eight eyes open, always dreaming All on the cauldron that is ever seeming"

Most of these boxes are made of infernal iron, though some are carved from bone or horn. Infernal puzzle boxes are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty infernal puzzle box weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it. When an object small enough to fit inside an infernal puzzle box is placed in it, the container magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every infernal puzzle box is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular infernal puzzle box, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents. A creature that spends 1 hour holding an infernal puzzle box while trying to open it can make a 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open the box. If the check fails by 5 or more, the creature must make a 18 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

You can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again. The tack doesn't conjure a nightmare; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil."

Shield Bond: As a bonus action, choose a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you, other than yourself. Until the end of your next turn, any damage the target takes is reduced to 1, but you take half the damage prevented in this way. The damage you take can't be reduced in any way. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Shield Ward: You can transfer the ingot's magic to a nonmagical item—a shield or a two-handed melee weapon-by tracing the skold rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the ingot is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:"

    "Description": "This musical instrument has 3 charges. While you are playing it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the instrument and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of you. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and choose to make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical darkness. Casting magic on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours. The instrument regains all expended charges daily at dawn."

The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC. You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component. All instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: fly, invisibility, levitate, and good. In addition, the Anstruth harp can be used to cast weather, wounds (5th level), and thorns."

When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect. A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra 1d8 thunder damage. Earth Mastery: You gain the following benefits while you hold Ironfang: You can speak Terran fluently. You have resistance to acid damage. You have MM out to a range of 60 feet. You can sense the presence of precious metals and stones within 60 feet of you, but not their exact location. You can cast monster (save 17) on an elemental. Once you have done so, Ironfang can't be used this way again until the next dawn. Shatter: Ironfang has 3 charges. You can use your action to expend 1 charge and cast the 2nd-level version of shatter (17). Ironfang regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. The Rumbling: While inside an earth node, you can perform a ritual called the Rumbling, using Ironfang to create a PotA. Once you perform the ritual, Ironfang can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn. Flaw: Ironfang heightens its wielder's destructive nature. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: I like to break things and cause ruin."

When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a GGR. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed."

When the jewel is found, only Sehanine's power thrums within its dormant heart. The power of the other two deities waits to be reawakened by a hero—or heroes—who can follow in Alyxian's footsteps. Dormant State: In this state, the Jewel of Three Prayers is a glittering golden disk attached to a fine golden chain. The chain magically resizes to function as a necklace for the creature that wears it. In its Dormant State, the jewel has the following properties: You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing the jewel. While wearing or holding the jewel, you can use an action to cause it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light lasts until you extinguish it (no action required). The jewel has 3 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the jewel, you can expend 1 charge from it to cast the invisibility spell."

    "Description": "A keystone of creation is a piece of the AitFR-AVT, usually between 6 to 10 inches on a side, and can be rough-hewn or cleanly cut and polished by a mason attuned to the AitFR-AVT. Random Properties: A keystone of creation has the following random properties: 1 minor beneficial property 1 beneficial manifestation 1 detrimental manifestation Extradimensional Places: You can use the keystone to conjure an extradimensional space such as mansion. The easiest way is to simply cast the spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see Construction Details. Raising Structures: You can use the keystone to conjure a physical structure on the Material Plane. The easiest way is to simply cast the XGE spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see Construction Details. Locations conjured by keystones cannot become permanent through repeated spell castings. Connected Spaces: You can use multiple keystones to create larger spaces, whether adjacent to each other or even interlinked. You can even combine structures on the Material Plane and extradimensional spaces this way. If you are attuned to one keystone when you attune to a second keystone, the keystones combine to become a single artifact (utilizing a single attunement slot), combining their features and their fates forevermore. You cannot attune to, and thus combine, more than three keystones at once. Destroying a Keystone: A keystone is an artifact in its own right and impervious to most damage, but a disintegrate spell is sufficient to destroy an unattuned keystone. After it has been attuned at least once, a given keystone requires attunement to maintain its magical power. Otherwise, its creations on the Material Plane gradually rot and decay over 1 days, and a demiplane relying on the keystone collapses over 10 minutes. Additional destructive forces like fire may hasten the destruction. A demiplane created or upheld by a keystone ejects all creatures within it to their home planes when it collapses. When a keystone's creation is fully destroyed, the keystone becomes an inert, powerless rock. If the AitFR-AVT is destroyed, all its keystones break attunement, lose all magical properties, and their creations decay or collapse to nothing. If it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck by a forked, metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the shift spell), a keystone is destroyed. Construction Details: You can customize a keystone's creation with cosmetic details you can imagine. You can also rearrange the floorplans and structural details of your creations as follows. Demiplane Design: With a single keystone, you can conjure an extradimensional space in the shape of a dome or pyramid, up to 1 mile on each side, with whatever terrain you wish. The edges of this space are solid and impassable but may be invisible, so that your space can appear to go on forever if you wish. With additional keystones, you can add an additional square mile to your creation, adding or combining terrain types. Each square mile can include a single structure up to the size of mansion, with all the attendant servants and feasts, or any number of smaller structures that together equal a magnificent mansion in total area. You cannot create flora or fauna that deal damage or otherwise harm creatures. If you create cliffs, waters, or other natural features, however, creatures in the space might fall, drown, or otherwise be harmed. Physical Structure Design: With a single keystone, you can create a structure akin to a mighty fortress with the added flexibility to customize that fortress not only for cosmetic details but for substantive effects. With a single keystone, you can rearrange the walls, open spaces, floors, doors, and other features of the mighty fortress provided you do not exceed 150 10-foot-wide cubes of interior space. Your fortress can reach across a creek, river, or other waters. It can take reckless or even dangerous shapes to include deep pits, flooded chambers, and so on. Your design, once conjured, is not guaranteed to be capable of supporting its own weight or surviving the stresses of attacks, weather, or time. You may post any number of your structure's servants as guards, if you wish. They have statistics identical to an unseen servant with the addition of a passive Perception score equal to your own, though you cannot perceive through their senses. The servants can ring bells or otherwise manipulate the environment to raise an alarm. Manifestations: Each place or structure conjured by a keystone of creation has special, unforeseen manifestations that affect its makeup and appearance. Some manifestations are beneficial, some are detrimental. These manifestations change each time a keystone is used to conjure a structure or place. The DM may roll or choose from the following tables, or devise unique manifestations based on the specific creations being conjured."

Spear of the Sun: This spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra 2d8 radiant damage. Blessing of the Sun: If you are a worshiper of Heliod, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:  If you aren't a worshiper of Heliod, the spear has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties. See Artifacts in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties. Luminous: The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight. Sun's Retaliation: When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can't be used again until the next dawn. Spells: The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: bolt (1 charge), daylight (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), sunbeam (6 charges). The spear regains 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Destroying the Spear: If taken to Erebos's palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, Khrusor is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos's service."

Its innards are connected to a secure coffer within Head Office's vault in Waterdeep, to which the satchel periodically transfers the franchise's wealth. As an action, you can transfer any amount of your franchise funds back to your satchel with a successful 15 Dexterity (Hand) check. Secret Satchel: As a rank 3 hoardsperson, your living loot satchel gets an upgrade to function as the replica chest used for the chest spell, becoming a rare magic item. You can open the secret chest through your living loot satchel to deposit or withdraw items—even items that wouldn't normally fit in your satchel, but which fit within the chest. Thanks to Head Office striking deals you don't want to know about with extraplanar creatures you really don't want to know about, there is no chance for the spell to end. That Thing You Need: At rank 3, you can use a bonus action to reach into your living loot satchel and make a 15 Dexterity (Hand) check. On a success, you draw forth an item of your choice on the Adventuring Gear table in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook. The item must be of a size that can fit into your secret chest and be worth no more than 15 gp. Once you attempt to draw five items from your satchel, you cannot draw forth any more items until the next dawn. Portable Hole Satchel: At rank 4, your living loot satchel receives another upgrade, becoming a very rare magic item. The secret chest accessed by your satchel now has the storage capacity of a hole—6 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. As before, you can place any appropriately sized object into the portable-hole-sized chest, even if it wouldn't normally fit into your satchel. That Expensive Thing You Need: Also at rank 4, when you use your That Thing You Need feature, you can requisition any item of up to 250 gp in value, as long as it would fit into the confines of your satchel's portable hole."

This ship's main distinctive feature is the fully grown treant on the aft deck. The treant has a speed of 0 because its roots are woven into the deck; it and the ship are inseparable. If the ship is reduced to 0 hit points, the treant dies of shock. The ship can function if its treant dies, but the treant can never be replaced with another. When the treant finishes a long rest, it repairs the ship's hull, enabling the ship to regain 4d12 hit points, and refreshes the ship's air envelope (turning deadly air into foul air, or foul air into fresh air). A living ship can float on water and sail across it, but it can't land safely on the ground (its keel would cause it to roll on its side). Its standard weaponry is an aft-mounted ballista."

The target can then immediately spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). If the target has no unspent Hit Dice remaining, nothing happens. You can use a curative arrow only once per turn. Spellcasting: While holding the bow, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save 18): water (1 charge), bond (2 charges), faith (3 charges)."

Creatures can communicate telepathically with you only if you allow it. Lord's Amulet: This amulet bears the crest of Waterdeep. It functions as an location.

    "Description": "Not all lingering spirits are tragic souls, lost on their way to the hereafter. Some languish as prisoners, souls so wicked mortals dare not free them upon an unsuspecting afterlife. Created by a figure of Vistani legend, Luba's Tarokka of Souls shaped the destiny of countless heroes. The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped. In the most dire cases, Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate, imprisoning them within her CoS. There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will. Like all tarokka decks, the Souls is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords. Random Properties: The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the Artifacts section of the DMG: 2 minor detrimental properties 2 minor beneficial properties Spells: While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: languages, good, magic, disease, object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn. Enduring Vision: While holding the deck, you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells. Twist of Fate: As an action, you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Choose one of the following effects:  The deck can be used in this way twice, and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn. Prisoners of Fate: Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property, there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes. Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table. If you roll one of the high cards, the soul associated with it escapes. You can find its statistics in the MM. If you roll a soul that has already escaped, roll again. The released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living. Until the released soul is destroyed, it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe. Shuffling Fate: If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's Tarokka of Souls ends, and you can't attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you. Destroying the Deck: Luba's Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed. This reveals a fifteenth soul, a lich, that inhabits the Nether card, which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated. If this ancient entity is destroyed, the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal CoS, with no special properties, but it includes a new card of the DM's design. Mother Luba and the Vistani: The creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists. A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. We may wander amid the shadows, Mother Luba said. But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers. Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice."

    "Description": "This mace has a haft of black iron and a ruby head with a fiendish countenance. Carrying the boon of Asmodeus, it is fit for the most powerful servants of the Nine Hells. Sentience: The Mace of the Black Crown is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal. Personality: A greedy erinyes named Xartaza lives within the Mace of the Black Crown. Xartaza wants to recruit more souls for Asmodeus, so the weapon pushes its wielder toward lawful evil actions by manipulating the wielder's dreams. A former Blood War general, Xartaza hates demons and relishes crafting sound battle plans in any conflict. Dormant: The mace grants the following benefits in its dormant state: You can speak, read, and write Infernal. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the mace, you can use a bonus action to speak its Infernal command word, causing flames to erupt from the head. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the mace is ablaze, it deals an extra 1d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you are no longer holding the mace. While holding the mace, you can use an action to summon an imp. Any devil you summon with this mace is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. The imp obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it and returns to the Nine Hells 10 minutes after you summoned it. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. Betrayer Artifact Properties: The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See Artifact Properties in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information."

Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components. A shield guardian's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer. The amulet's wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance. A spellcaster can store a single spell within a shield guardian, which can then cast the spell on command or under specific conditions.

In the hands of the god of the dead, the whip snares the reluctant dead and drags them into his realm. When Erebos grants his weapon to a mortal follower, it's typically to reclaim a powerful soul or to humiliate Heliod. Whip of the Dead: Erebos's whip seethes with the enervating energy of the Underworld. This magic whip grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this whip, the target takes an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. Additionally, when you make an attack with the whip on your turn, you can increase the range of the attack to 300 feet. This property of the weapon can't be used again until the next dusk. Blessing of the Dead: If you are a worshiper of Erebos, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:  If you aren't a worshiper of Erebos, the whip has 2 randomly determined major detrimental properties. See Artifacts in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties. Erebos's Claim: While carrying the whip, you can use an action to cast either death or monster (targeting only undead) from the whip. The save DC for these spells is 18. Once you use the whip to cast a spell, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dusk. Destroying the Whip: To destroy the whip, it must be taken to the heights of Mount Hiastos in Nyx, unraveled by a Returned, and left to bask in continual daylight for one month."

If you don't issue any, it takes the XPHB action and uses its movement to avoid danger. The flying wonder is destroyed if it drops to 0 XPHB."

A Mechanical Wonder is a dormant object until activated. To activate a Mechanical Wonder, you must wind the wonder with a handheld key unique to that wonder. It takes 1 minute to wind a Mechanical Wonder. While you wind it, you must take the XPHB action each turn. This wagon-sized vehicle is made of brassy metal and has a spiral-shaped propeller atop it. Its midsection is open on two sides. Once wound, the gyrocopter wonder remains active for 8 hours. While active, the gyrocopter can be used as a vehicle; it requires one pilot. The gyrocopter wonder is a Huge object that weighs 500 pounds and has the following statistics: AC 14, HP 50, XPHB 5 ft., and XPHB 20 ft. The gyrocopter can bear up to 2,000 pounds of cargo; if it bears any more than this, it deactivates. Eight spectral cords are mounted to the inside of the cargo bay. A creature riding in the gyrocopter wonder can take a XPHB action to attach itself to or detach itself from one of these cords. A creature attached to a cord can leap from the gyrocopter wonder and glide, moving up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it descends in the air. If a creature attached to a cord is ever more than 500 feet away from the gyrocopter, the cord immediately disappears and returns to the wonder."

    "Description": "Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the TCE is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction. Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the Mad. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o. Dangerous Attunement: Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens. The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact. Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact. Controlling the Servant: While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful 25 Dexterity check using PHB. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn. A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction. While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways: Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn) Move the servant up to its speed (no action required) As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action. When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature. While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object. Ghost in the Machine: Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed. If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible. Self-Destruct: By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other. If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains. This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant. Destroying the Servant: The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property."

While the mimir is floating, a creature other than you can use an action to grasp or net the device, either by making a successful unarmed strike against AC 22 or a successful 22 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use a bonus action to seize and stow the device. The device has AC 22, 25 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and resistance to all other damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it is floating near you. Esoteric Knowledge: While the device is floating, you can use an action to cast lore from the device. The device speaks the revealed lore aloud. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. Planar Knowledge: The device knows basic, useful information about the planes of existence. While the device is floating, it verbally answers questions you or anyone you designate poses to it about that topic. It knows the information about the planes in the Dungeon Master's Guide, as well as basic information about the gate-towns of the Outlands (presented in chapter 3 of Sigil and the Outlands)."

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

The item weighs 8 pounds. While you are wearing the mizzium apparatus, you can use it as an arcane focus. In addition, you can attempt to cast a spell that you do not know or have prepared. The spell you choose must be on your class's spell list and of a level for which you have a spell slot, and you must provide the spell's components. You expend a spell slot to cast the spell as normal, but before resolving it you must make an Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC is 10 + twice the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell. On a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell from the one you intended. Randomly determine the spell you cast by rolling on the table for the level of the spell slot you expended. If the slot is 6th level or higher, roll on the table for 5th-level spells. If you try to cast a cantrip you don't know, the DC for the Intelligence (Arcana) check is 10, and on a failed check, there is no effect."

Thus, only a few of these weapons remain. A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power. A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods. A moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table. Sentience: A moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep. Personality: Every moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals. Courage, loyalty, beauty, music, and life are all part of this purpose. The weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve. Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute. If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence. Once it has decided on an owner, it believes that only that person should wield it, even if the owner falls short of elven ideals."

    "Description": "You can use an action to place this 1-inch-diameter granite sphere on the ground and speak its command word, which is petrification in Terran. The sphere rapidly grows into a stout tower that remains until you use an action to touch the tower and speak the command word again, whereupon the tower shrinks back to a 1-inch-diameter granite sphere. The tower must be empty to shrink in this way. The tower bristles with muddy knobs that constantly extrude and retract across its surface, as though the tower were breathing through a coating of thick mud. Each creature in the area where the tower appears must make a 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically. Whenever it expands, the mudslick tower merges with any natural stone it touches, awkwardly tipping and wedging itself to touch as much natural stone as it can. The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening. Although it looks like stone, the tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents creatures from tipping it over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. While merged with natural stone, the mudslick tower has immunity to all damage. Only a wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points."

    "Description": "Roiling green mist fills this glass orb, which the exiled Strixhaven mage SCC once used in foul magical experiments. Murgaxor's spirit has infused the orb, which he uses to spread a terrible curse among Strixhaven's students. Sentience: Murgaxor's orb is a sentient, chaotic evil magic item with the following properties: The orb has an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 16, as well as hearing and darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. The orb can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature touching it. At any time during your turn, the orb can cast the suggestion spell (save 17), targeting you or one other creature that touched the orb within the last 24 hours. This isn't a power of the orb that you control. Curse: Any Humanoid you touch while holding the orb must succeed on a 10 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. Each creature cursed by the orb bears an echo of Murgaxor's hateful thoughts, and that creature suffers from headaches that are persistent but not debilitating until the curse ends. On your turn, the orb can use an action to produce one of the following effects, targeting one or more creatures it has cursed: Unconsciousness: The cursed creature falls unconscious for 1 hour. The creature is roused if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. Visions of Terror: The cursed creature sees terrifying visions, causing it to view all creatures that aren't also cursed as dangerous monsters for 10 minutes. The cursed creature must use its action each round to make one attack against the nearest non-cursed creature. If the cursed creature has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random. This effect ends if the cursed creature is incapacitated. After either of these effects ends, the affected creature is no longer cursed. The curse can also be removed from a creature with a curse spell or similar magic. All cases of the curse end if Murgaxor's orb is destroyed. Magical Signature: As a side effect of the orb's curse, the spell magic reveals an aura of enchantment surrounding creatures bearing the curse. This aura is distinctive, but in a way magic offers no further details about. Destroying the Orb: Murgaxor's orb has AC 18; 20 hit points; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to all other types of damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the orb shatters."

If the orb is destroyed or removed from its castle, the castle's altitude and location remain fixed until the orb is returned or replaced. As an action, you can cause one of the following effects to occur if you are touching the orb: The castle moves at a speed of 1 mph in a straight line, in a direction of your choice, until the castle stops or is made to stop, or until another action is used to change its direction. If this movement brings the castle into contact with the ground, the castle lands gently. The castle, if it is moving, comes to a gradual stop. The castle makes a slow, 90-degree turn clockwise or counterclockwise (turning a northerly view into a westerly view, for example). The castle can turn while it is moving in a straight line. Any creature touching the orb knows the altitude of the base of the castle above the ground or water below it."

    "Description": "Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image. Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons—that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet. When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create. Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material. If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything."

Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube. The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you must remain in the Cube, and requires XPHB. If your XPHB is broken or you leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted. When the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube.

The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn. When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage. While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons."

    "Description": "Head office grants you the use of a unique item known as an occultant abacus (sometimes just referred to as an occultant), whose beads resemble tiny skulls. Read the Kill: Also at rank 1, your occultant abacus not only tracks your franchise's kills, it helps you determine the impact of those kills on the franchise's fate. Over a period of 1 minute, you can study a creature killed by someone in your franchise within the last 24 hours, then grant the character who slew it a d10. Once within the next hour, that character can add the d10 to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. If it's not clear who administered the killing blow, you grant this benefit to a random creature involved in the fight. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Eldritch Occultant: Starting at rank 2, your occultant abacus becomes an uncommon magic item that can track lives both eliminated and saved. While holding your occultant abacus within 5 feet of a creature killed within the past 24 hours, you can cast the augury spell. The course of action you inquire about with the spell does not need to have any connection to the dead creature. This property of the occultant abacus can't be used again until the next dawn. Bring Out Your Dead: Also at rank 2, you regain the use of your Read the Kill feature after you finish a short or long rest. Bead of Instant Karma: At rank 3, one of the beads on your occultant abacus channels the power of instant karma, turning the occultant abacus into a rare magic item. As a reaction, you can target one creature you can see that is about to attempt an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, either granting advantage or imposing disadvantage on the roll. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your occultant abacus at the next dawn. Bead of Diverted Karma: At rank 4, one of the beads on your occultant abacus allows you to divert karma to where it's needed, turning the occultant abacus into a very rare magic item. While the bead is unused, you know automatically when any creature you can see is about to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw with disadvantage. When such a roll is made, you can use a reaction to grant a d10 to a different creature you can see. That creature can add the d10 to any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes within the next minute. The bead crumbles to dust when used, reappearing on your occultant abacus at the next dawn. Correct the Balance: As a rank 4 occultant, you learn that sometimes the death of a creature has unintended consequences. Within seven days of a creature's death, you can use your occultant abacus to divine ways to reverse or mitigate events resulting from that death. As an action, make a 15 Intelligence (Religion) check. On a success, you learn the relevant information based on the nature of the creature and its place in the world. If you fail the check, this property of the occultant abacus can't be used again until the next dawn. If you succeed on the check, this property can't be used again until dawn seven days later."

The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be covered in oil. If the target takes Fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an extra 5 Fire damage from burning oil. Dousing a Space: You can take the XPHB action to pour an Oil flask on level ground to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. If lit, the oil burns until the end of the turn 2 rounds from when the oil was lit (or 12 seconds) and deals 5 Fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn there. A creature can take this damage only once per turn. Fuel: Oil serves as fuel for Lamps and Lanterns. Once lit, a flask of Oil burns for 6 hours in a Lamp or Lantern. That duration doesn't need to be consecutive; you can extinguish the burning Oil (as a XPHB action) and rekindle it again until it has burned for a total of 6 hours."

Ignite: As an action, you can ignite an object within 10 feet of you. The object must be flammable, and the fire starts in a circle no larger than 1 foot in diameter. Fires Friend: You have resistance to cold damage. Fire Tamer: As an action, you can extinguish any open flame within 10 feet of you. You choose how much fire to extinguish in that radius. Gift of Flame: You can transfer the opal's magic to a nonmagical item—a weapon or a suit of armor—by tracing the ild rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the opal is destroyed, and the rune appears in red on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:"

Aided by a mysterious magician (actually an aspect of Tiamat in disguise), Damara eventually created an Artifact that would enable him to achieve his dream. Yet the potential power of his creation terrified Damara so much that he dared not use the orb. Instead, the wizard entombed himself with the Artifact to seal it away. The Orb of Damara is about 6 inches in diameter and is made of a glassy, iridescent material that's like obsidian but incredibly hard. If held to one's own lips with the intention of consuming it, the orb shrinks to the size of a grape. Properties of the Orb: While attuned to the orb, you gain the following benefits: Dragon's Breath: You can take a XPHB action to exhale a 15-foot Cone. When you do, choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison. Each creature in the Cone makes a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 damage of the chosen type on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Fear Aura: You exude a terrifying aura in a 20-foot Emanation while you don't have the XPHB condition. You can take a XPHB action to disable or enable this aura. Any enemy that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or have the XPHB condition until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on this save is immune to the aura's effects for 24 hours. Flight: You have a XPHB of 60 feet and can hover. Random Properties: The Artifact has the following random properties (see chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide): 2 minor beneficial properties 2 minor detrimental properties Spellcasting: The orb has 6 charges and regains 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While attuned to the orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it (+10 spell attack modifier, spell save DC 18). The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. Dragon Transformation: If you swallow the orb, you transform into an adult chromatic dragon under the DM's control. The type of chromatic dragon depends on your alignment and personality and is left to the DM to decide. The transformation is permanent, but if the dragon is slain, its body reverts to its original form and the orb reappears outside its body. Destroying the Orb: If an XMM willingly swallows the orb, the orb and the dragon are both destroyed."

    "Description": "Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic. As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons. Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb. An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it. While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides. Random Properties: An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 minor detrimental property 1 major detrimental property Spells: The orb has 7 charges and regains 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the magic spell from the orb without using any charges. Call Dragons: While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as RoT are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour. Destroying an Orb: An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however."

You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon: You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an orc, that orc must succeed on a 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. You can't be surprised by orcs while you're not incapacitated. You are also aware when orcs are within 120 feet of you and aren't behind total cover, although you don't know their location. You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can't be frightened while you're not incapacitated. Sentience: Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has darkvision. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder's mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse. Personality: Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face orcs in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves—giants, goblins, and, most of all, orcs—and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle."

    "Description": "This delicate and exquisitely crafted clockwork orrery features multiple geared components whose sweeping hands and dials represent the complex interplay of planar and magical realms. Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent. The Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm. To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again—and moving closer to each other all the time. Random Properties. The orrery has the following randomly determined properties: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 major beneficial property 1 major detrimental properties The random properties of the orrery might function only when all its components are installed, or might function sporadically if any components are missing. The Sum of Its Parts: Each of the six components that powers the Orrery of the Wanderer is a powerful magic relic in its own right: The AI The AI The AI The AI The AI The AI Creatures can attune to the orrery's components individually. If attuned to an individual component, a creature must hold the component to make use of its features. A creature can also attune to the orrery and all the components installed in it. Attuning to an installed component doesn't count against the number of magic items you can normally attune to. While a component is not installed in the orrery, its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM. Future Echoes: With or without its components, the orrery lets you catch momentary glimpses of the future that warn you of danger. As long as the orrery is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Into the Void: With or without its components, the attuned orrery infuses your spirit with the tumultuous energy of the planes. Over time, your alignment changes to chaotic neutral, and you are compelled to engage with and explore the most dangerous planar realms. Master of Travel: While all six components of the Orrery of the Wanderer are installed, the artifact has 7 charges. While touching the orrery, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save 17): plane (3 charges), demiplane (6 charges), gate (7 charges), shift (5 charges), or circle (3 charges). The orrery regains 4 expended charges daily at dawn."

On command, the keyrune transforms into a GGR for up to 2 hours. If you don't come from an Orzhov oligarch family, it serves you grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements and mannerisms while carrying out your orders. When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a GGR. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed."

The bird is an object that has 1 hit point, an Armor Class of 13, a flying speed of 60 feet, a Dexterity of 16 (+3), and a score of 1 (−5) in all other abilities, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. It travels to within 5 feet of its intended recipient by the most direct route, whereupon it turns into a nonmagical and inanimate sheet of parchment that can be unfolded only by the intended recipient. If the bird's hit points or speed is reduced to 0 or if it is otherwise immobilized, it turns into ash. Paper birds usually come in small, flat boxes containing 3 sheets of the parchment."

    "Description": "This blue pennant is crafted from silk and is five feet long and whips about as if buffeted by a wind. The vind (wind) rune appears on its surface, looking almost like a cloud. The pennant has the following properties, which work only while it's on your person. Wind Step: As an action, you fly up to 20 feet. If you don't land at the end of this flight, you fall unless you have another means of staying aloft. Comforting Wind: You can't suffocate. Winds Grasp: As a reaction when you fall, you can cause yourself to take no damage from the fall. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Wind Walker: While you are attuned to this rune, you can cast levitate as a bonus action. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Gift of Wind: You can transfer the pennant's magic to a nonmagical item—a suit of armor, a pair of boots, or a cloak—by tracing the vind rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the pennant is destroyed, and the rune appears in silver on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:"

    "Description": "While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rats and giant rats are Indifferent toward you and won't attack you unless you threaten or harm them. The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes as a XPHB action, you can take a XPHB to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one XMM with each expended charge if enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise. Whenever a Swarm of Rats that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes a 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the pipes' music and becomes Friendly to you and your allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as a XPHB action. A Friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn more than 30 feet away from you, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours."

The spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 minute, whichever comes first. The spirit is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count but takes its turn immediately after yours. The spirit obeys your commands (no action required by you); if you don't issue any commands, the spirit takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

    "Description": "Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

The weapon deals 2d4 radiant damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for a light hammer. It deals an extra 2d4 radiant damage to chromatic dragons. Once three scales have been pulled from the scarf, no more scales can be removed until the next dawn, when all the missing scales grow back.

You can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can't be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it. You can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what's in it, the hole weighs next to nothing. If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole's extradimensional space can use an action to make a 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a holding, haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened."

When you meet someone for the first time, their details and a rough sketch are magically stored on a small parchment card in the portfolio keeper. You can access the details of any such stored card as a bonus action. Cards of Sending: At rank 3, the power of your portfolio keeper becomes more potent, making it a rare magic item. When you give out a business card stored in your portfolio keeper, you can choose to have the card allow its recipient to contact you through your AI as if they had cast a sending spell. A business card loses this power seven days after it has been given out, and no more than five cards can have this power at one time. You can also use your AI to cast sending and contact anyone who has one of your business cards. Once you use this feature of the stone, you cannot use it again until dawn seven days later. Charming Introduction: Also at rank 4, you are able to make a focused effort to keep a potential customer's attention. When you provide a humanoid with a business card from your portfolio keeper, you can cast person on them (save 15). The spell ends prematurely if the character loses the business card."

In addition, the reach of your melee attacks increases by 5 feet. Everything you are carrying and wearing also increases in size for the duration. When rolling damage for weapons enlarged in this manner, roll three times the normal number of dice; for example, an enlarged longsword would deal 3d8 slashing damage (instead of 1d8), or 3d10 slashing damage (instead of 1d10) when used with two hands. When the effect ends, any hit points you have above your hit point maximum become temporary hit points.

    "Description": "Powered armor resembles a suit of unusual plate armor, with finely articulated joints connected by an oily, black, leather-like material. The armor has been worked to create the appearance of a heavily muscled warrior, and its great helm is unusual in that it has no openings—only a broad glass plate in the front with a second piece of glass above it. Strange plates, tubing, and large metal bosses adorn the armor in seemingly random fashion. On the back of the armor's left gauntlet is a rectangular metal box, from which projects a short rod tipped with a cone-shaped red crystal. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits: You have a +1 bonus to AC. Your Strength score is 18 (this has no effect if your Strength is already 18 or higher). You have advantage on death saving throws. The armor has further capabilities that can be powered either by energy cells or by your own life energy. You can use a bonus action to draw power from an energy cell or sacrifice hit points to gain one of the following benefits: Emit a force field to gain 5 temporary hit points (1 charge or 5 hit points). Activate boosters to gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points). Fire arm-mounted laser: rw 8 to hit, range 120 feet, one target. {@h}2d6 radiant damage (1 charge or 5 hit points). Translate any writing you can see in any nonmagical language, to a total of one thousand words over 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points). Fill the armor with air, allowing you to breathe normally in any environment for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points). Gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points). The armor can accept only one energy cell at a time. It is found with one energy cell attached, containing 2d10 charges. Powered Armor Options: Depending on where and how it appears in the adventure, you might wish to modify the features of Kwalish's legendary powered armor. Automatic Defenses: Unless Kwalish deactivates the suit's automatic defenses, no one can approach the armor without setting those defenses off. Treat the armor as a guardian that has stored a missile spell cast using a 4th-level spell slot. When the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, its defenses are rendered inert and it can be safely approached. Battle of Wills: When donned by a new user, the armor deems itself superior and attempts to take possession of that user. The user must succeed on a 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the armor. While possessed, the user is incapacitated and loses control of its body but retains its awareness. The armor uses the possessed user's statistics (as adjusted by the armor), but doesn't gain access to the user's knowledge, features, or proficiencies. Freeing a creature trapped inside the armor first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). The trapped creature can also attempt a 20 Charisma saving throw each day at dawn. On a successful save, the armor no longer controls the creature and can be safely donned by that creature at any time. Stasis: Whenever a creature wearing the armor drops to 0 hit points, the armor places that creature into a state of stasis. While in this state, the creature is stable and does not make death saving throws, but the armor takes control of the creature (as above). Additionally, the armor attempts to assume the identity of the user, assuring their allies that nothing is amiss. Freeing the user first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). A creature in stasis does not make Charisma saving throws to break the armor's control. Alternative Power: Powered armor originally required energy cells to fuel it, but was adapted by Kwalish to be fueled by the life energy of the creature wearing it. You might decide that the armor can also draw power from additional sources, or that energy cells can be recharged with the aid of a tinker, inventor, or artificer. It might also be possible for allies to connect to the armor through the use of magic that generates a conduit something like an astral silver cord. While so connected, a willing ally can give up hit points as a reaction to fuel the armor's abilities."

The armor is powered by an cell stored in a compartment on the thigh plate. Placing a full cell in the armor gives the armor 24 charges. A suit of powered armor functions as a suit of normal plate armor, even when it has 0 charges remaining. Activating the Armor: As an action, you can expend any number of the armor's charges to activate it; the armor remains active for 1 hour per charge expended. You can use a bonus action to deactivate the armor early, but doing so doesn't recover any expended charges. While the armor is active, you gain the following benefits: Augmented Physicality: You have advantage on Strength checks, and your carrying capacity is doubled. Environmental Adaptation: The armor seals airtight and provides its own atmosphere. You can breathe normally in any environment and withstand extreme temperatures, and you're unaffected by harmful gases, as well as contact and inhaled poisons. Force Field: When you would take damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the armor's charges to deploy a defensive force field. Roll 3d10 and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled. Propulsion: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the armor's charges to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. If you're airborne when this duration ends, you fall. Replacing the Energy Cell: While the armor has charges remaining, its cell can't be removed. Once the armor has 0 charges, you can replace the cell with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action."

It is so directly tied to him that one of his worshipped symbols is a two-pronged fork. The weapon never leaves his side, and he is a master at wielding it. The Ranseur of Torture is a magic pike. You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and it does 2d10 piercing damage instead of its regular damage. When you hit a good aligned creature with it, that creature takes an extra 1d10 necrotic damage. Random Properties: The Ranseur of Torture has the following random properties: 1 minor beneficial property 1 major beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property Wounding: Damage dealt by the Ranseur of Torture is particularly dangerous, as it can only be restored through magical means. Resting, food, and medicine won't restore hit points removed by the pike. If the damage goes untreated for 7 days, the missing hit points are permanently removed, and can be recovered only through casting a Regenerate or Wish spell on the victim. Execution: If a creature with less than its full hit points is hit by this pike, the Ranseur of Torture deals 1d10 additional piercing damage. If a creature is killed by the pike, their soul is sent to Phlegethos and can be restored only through casting a Wish spell on the victim. Staggered: Each time a creature takes damage from the Ranseur of Torture, they must make a Constitution save, with a DC equaling the damage they took. On a failed save, their movement speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn. This penalty stacks, though movement speed can't be reduced below 0. Interrupting: Spellcasters damaged by the Ranseur of Torture have disadvantage on Constitution checks made to maintain concentration until the damage is healed. If a creature is concentrating on a spell when damaged by the ranseur, their concentration is immediately ended. Destroying the Ranseur: Only through the written consent of both Dispater and Belial can the Ranseur of Torture be destroyed. If either or both of the archdevils are dead, then the new archdevil to take their mantle must give permission in their stead. The two writs must be wrapped around each of the prongs of the weapon, then the weapon must be tossed into the Pit of Flame. If performed successfully, the Hellfire briefly burns a different hue."

Draconic Majesty: While you are wearing no armor, you can add your Charisma bonus to your Armor Class. Dragon Breath: If you have a breath weapon that requires rest to recharge, it gains a recharge of 6. Dragon Sight: You gain darkvision out to 60 feet, or to an additional 60 feet if you already have that sense. Once per day, you can gain blindsight out to 30 feet for 5 minutes. Dragon Tongue: You can speak and understand Draconic. You also have advantage on any Charisma check you make against Red Dragons. Legendary Resistance: (1/Day) If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Dragon Fire: If you deal fire damage to a creature or flammable object, it starts burning. At the start of each of its turns, a creature burning in this way takes 1d6 fire damage. A creature that can reach the burning target can use an action to extinguish the fire."

The djinni appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane. While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions. After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies."

While wearing the ring, you can take a XPHB action to expend 1 to 3 charges to make a ranged spell attack against one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 Force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you. Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's charges as a XPHB action to try to break a nonmagical object you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn't being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend."

    "Description": "ToA has kept this item in his possession for over a century. The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can't melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to this ring. The Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see Sentient Magic Items chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring the wearer's doom. Sentience: The Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others. Nondetection: The Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. Frozen Time: As long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost. Cold Immunity: While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon's Master Guide). Magic: The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties: You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute. You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), storm (2 charges), sphere (3 charges), storm (1 charge), growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or ice (2 charges). You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary. Other Properties: The Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as the mighty ice primordial named Cryonax. Destroying the Ring: The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever."

You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.

The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below. Six Buttons: You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form. If you press button 1, the rod becomes a tongue as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type of sword). If you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form. If you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers. If you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it. Drain Life: When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target rakes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. Paralyze: When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. Terrify: While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don't age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down). When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can't be used again until ten days have passed."

    "Description": "Eons ago, a war between the primordials and the gods scarred the planes of existence. A demon lord named VEoR eventually pushed the primordials' enemies to the brink of annihilation. Desperate to save themselves and their allies, powerful elemental beings called the Wind Dukes of Aaqa rose against Miska. Committed to the concept of law, the Wind Dukes descended from a people called the vaati, who once ruled many worlds. Seven Wind Dukes wove their power into an artifact called the Rod of Law. The dukes used the rod to imprison Miska on the plane of Pandemonium. As a result, the rod shattered into seven parts that were scattered throughout the multiverse. The rod thus became known as the Rod of Seven Parts. Possessing the Broken Rod: The rod can't be attuned to while it is broken. While holding one piece of the broken rod, you know the general location of the next consecutive piece, as the rod yearns to be a complete artifact. Multiple rod pieces can be assembled into one piece or disassembled again, each requiring an action, although a partially complete rod doesn't gain any other abilities. Additionally, while holding one piece of the broken rod, you can use an action to cast the spell associated with that piece, as listed on the Rod Pieces table. Once that piece of the rod has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used that way again until the next dawn. Possessing the Whole Rod: Once all seven pieces are reassembled, a creature can attune to the Rod of Seven Parts. While attuned to the rod, you gain the following benefits: Magic Weapon: The Rod of Seven Parts functions for you as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. Rod Spellcasting: The Rod of Seven Parts has 7 charges and regains 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast any of the spells in the Rod Pieces table. You can also use an action to cast Good from the rod without using any charges. Ultimate Law: If you are not of a lawful alignment, you find your worldview shifting toward keeping a personal code. You are more apt to keep your promises, follow through on your declarations, and adhere to your beliefs. Destroying the Rod: The only way to destroy the Rod of Seven Parts is to immerse the assembled rod in lava in the Abyss. It must remain in the lava for fifty years before it finally is consumed. A piece of the rod may be temporarily destroyed in this way, but each piece re-forms one year after it has succumbed. A re-formed piece teleports to a random place in the multiverse."

    "Description": "Asmodeus's Ruby Rod is said to have been constructed from a shard of pure evil, a ruby soaked in the blood of the innocents, the drool from a draconic deity, and the tears of 777 angels. It is a magic rod that functions as a morningstar and you have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. All damage dealt with it is converted to necrotic, and when you hit a good aligned creature, that creature takes an extra 2d12 necrotic damage. The Ruby Rod of Asmodeus has 66 charges and regains 6d6 charges each nightfall. Asmodeus is always capable of perceiving through the rod and knows the exact location of any creature attuned to it. If a creature uses the special abilities of the rod without Asmodeus's permission, they take 2d12 necrotic damage each use, doubled if they're good aligned. This damage ignores resistances and immunities, and if it kills the user, Asmodeus permanently claims their soul. Random Properties: The Ruby Rod of Asmodeus has the following random properties: 1 minor beneficial property 1 major beneficial property 2 major detrimental properties Asmodeus is immune to the detrimental properties of the weapon. Bow to the King: You may use an action to expend 33 charges to use the rod to force all creatures within a 150-foot-radius to bow to you. A creature must succeed on a 21 Charisma saving throw or be forced to kneel for up to 1 hour. Creatures immune to the charmed condition have advantage on their save. Each time a kneeling creature takes damage, they may repeat the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends early for kneeling creatures if they're touched by the Ruby Rod. Acid, Cold, and Lightning: At a cost of 9 charges each use, you may use an action to trigger one of the following effects: You project acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d8 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You project an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 12d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You shoot lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Reactions: As a reaction to suffering a detrimental effect, you may cast Restoration (expending 3 charges) or Restoration (expending 12 charges.) Additionally, if you're the sole target of a spell, you may use a reaction to attempt to use the rod to absorb the spell and cancel its effect. You roll 2, and if the result is higher than the spell level + 10, the spell is absorbed into the rod. The rod regains charges equal to the spell level it absorbed. If the absorbed charges go over the maximum of 66 charges, it overloads, dealing 1d6 necrotic damage per charge to you and expending all charges. Destroying the Rod: While Asmodeus lives, the Ruby Rod of Asmodeus can't be destroyed, and if attempted it simply returns to Asmodeus. If he were defeated, the rod could be destroyed by bringing it to the Abyss from whence it was created, then performing a ritual known only to Asmodeus."

Sentience: Ruin's Wake is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 22. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Orc. Personality: A slaughter-loving balor named Yarrowish lives within Ruin's Wake. The weapon desires only to draw blood and pushes its wielder to solve problems with violence. Dormant: The spear grants the following benefits in its dormant state: You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Orc. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and it deals an extra 1d8 piercing damage to any target it hits. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it flies back to your hand. As a reaction when you are hit by a melee attack, you can make a melee attack with Ruin's Wake with advantage against the attacker. You can't use this property again until you finish a short or long rest. Betrayer Artifact Properties: The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See Artifact Properties in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information."

    "Description": "Ruinblade is a unique weapon possessed by IMR, the architect of the Tomb of Horrors. A symbol of his authority, Moghadam carries the weapon during the time frame of the adventure to intimidate the tomb's workers. (In later years, after ToA trapped Moghadam in the completed tomb as an undead archwraith, Moghadam was able to use the weapon as his own phylactery.) A small jade version of the green devil face of the Tomb of Horrors is fashioned into the hilt of the weapon, with the blade extending from its open mouth. The blade always appears ruined and rusting, and causes its surroundings to appear reflected in the blade as if in a state of decay. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit an undead creature with it, the attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage. In addition, the weapon has the following properties: Blighted Ruin: You can cast the blight spell from the weapon (15). Once used, this property of the weapon can't be used until the next dawn. Destructive Ruin: You can cast the disintegrate spell from the weapon, but can target only a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. Once used, this property of the weapon can't be used until dawn seven days later. Curse: This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a curse spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon. The weapon must take direct part in the destruction of 1,000 gp worth of materials and objects every seven days, or a conflict arises between you and the weapon at the end of the seventh day. Sentience: Ruinblade is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is a rough, ruined echo. While you are attuned to it, Ruinblade also understands every language you know. Personality: Ruinblade speaks either with a dolorous or frenetic tone, depending on its mood. That mood improves when the sword is actively engaged in acts of destruction, but worsens if the blade is left inactive too long. The weapon's purpose is to ruin and unmake existing objects, so that its owner can rebuild the world from a blank slate. It thus encourages its wielder to engage in constant destruction, claiming that this will allow the creation of a more superior vision from the ruin of what came before."

The possibilities here are broad, but in combat it's simplest to allow them the opportunity to rewind one action and take it again, or to reroll a failed saving throw (if it can still take actions). Each use of the artifact has a terrible side effect: someone known to the wielder is also erased from reality. After the villain uses the ruinstone, roll a d20: on a 5-20, one of their allies disintegrates, on an 1-4, one of the player characters disintegrates. If a creature bound its soul to the ruinstone in the Thalivar's Beacon quest, the artifact explodes when used and the creature who is bound to it disintegrates, disappearing from reality and can only be brought back with a wish spell, or similar magic."

    "Description": "Saint Markovia's thighbone has the properties of a disruption. If it scores one or more hits against a vampire or a spawn in the course of a single battle, the thighbone crumbles into dust once the battle concludes. As a youth, Markovia followed her heart and became a priest of the Morninglord soon after her eighteenth birthday. She proved to be a charismatic proselytizer and, before the age of thirty, had gained a reputation for allowing no evil to stand before her. Markovia had long considered Strahd a mad tyrant, but only after his transformation into a vampire did she dare to challenge him. As she rallied her followers and prepared to march on Castle Ravenloft, Strahd sent a group of spawn to her abbey. They confronted Markovia and were destroyed to a one. Suffused with confidence born of a righteous victory, Markovia advanced on Castle Ravenloft. A great battle raged from the catacombs to the parapets. In the end, Markovia never returned to Barovia, and Strahd long afterward walked with a limp and a grimace of pain. It is said that he trapped Markovia in a crypt beneath his castle, and her remains linger there yet. The essence of Markovia's saintliness passed partly into her bones as the rest of her body decomposed. Her remaining thighbone is imbued with power that inflicts grievous injury on the undead. Disruption. When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn. While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet."

Whether or not the shadow is snipped, this property of the scissors can't be used again until the next dawn. The detached shadow is rooted to the spot where it was snipped until you use a bonus action to cause it to behave in one of the following ways, either of which is possible only if you can see the shadow: You control the shadow's movements and can make the shadow move up to 30 feet across a solid or liquid surface, in any direction you choose (including along vertical surfaces), provided it remains within your sight at all times. The shadow is harmless and unable to be harmed, and it is invisible in darkness. It can't speak, and it doesn't require air, sleep, or nourishment. You can relinquish control of the shadow, at which point it becomes autonomous and behaves as the DM wishes. It uses the shadow stat block in the Monster Manual, but its creature type is Fey instead of Undead. A creature whose Strength is reduced to 0 by this shadow's Strength Drain attack does not die but falls unconscious instead. The creature regains consciousness and all its Strength after finishing a short or long rest. A creature whose shadow has detached from it is cursed. If a shadowless creature is subjected to any spell that ends a curse, or if its detached shadow is reduced to 0 hit points, the detached shadow disappears, and the creature regains its normal shadow instantly."

    "Description": "Said to be a gift to Glasya from Asmodeus, the Scourge of Shadow is a multi-headed whip constructed from infernal iron. The scourge is nigh-in- destructible, and Glasya carries it with her wherever she goes. When she wields the whip in battle, it shrouds her in an aura of shadow. The Scourge of Shadow is a magic whip. You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and it does 3d4 slashing damage instead of its regular damage. When you hit a good aligned creature with it, that creatures takes an extra 4d4 necrotic damage. Whenever an unattuned creature attacks with the weapon, it deals 2d4 necrotic damage, ignoring resistances and immunities, to them, but otherwise functions normally. Random Properties: The Scourge of Shadow has the following random properties: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 major beneficial property 2 minor detrimental properties 1 major detrimental property Keen: The whip scores a critical on a roll of 18, 19, or 20. When it scores a critical, its damage dice are upgraded to 3d6 instead of 3d4 for the duration of the attack. If attacking a good aligned creature, or attacking with the weapon unattuned, the necrotic damage dice are also increased to a d6 instead of a d4. Fast Reflexes: While attuned to the Scourge of Shadow, you gain advantage on initiative rolls, and you add your Charisma and Dexterity modifiers to the roll. You may use either your Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls (the same modifier must be used for both attack and damage). Veil of Shadow: You're protected by a field of shadow that makes you resistant to radiant and necrotic damage. While in dim light or darkness you gain blindsight out to 60 feet and Dexterity (Stealth) checks are made with advantage. Destroying the Scourge: Though the process is known only to Glasya and Asmodeus, the Scourge of Shadow can be destroyed. It must be taken to the Pit of Fire in Phlegethos. The scourge, along with the body of an archdevil, must be thrown into the Hellfire together. As they hit the flames, a spell of Darkness must be cast at 9th level on the scourge. If each part of the ritual is performed correctly, the whip disintegrates within the Hellfire."

The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed."

    "Description": "Also at rank 1, you are given use of an Acquisitions Incorporated sending stone, an uncommon magic item that resembles a gemstone in a bold setting. It functions like a normal sending stone, except that it has no matching stone and allows communication with Head Office, specific secretarians you know, and the secretarian nearest your location. You must succeed on a 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to establish contact. Once the stone is successfully used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. Making contact with another secretarian assumes that they are in possession of their own sending stone. Rumor Mill: Also at rank 2, whenever your franchise begins a major quest or mission, make a 15 Intelligence (History) check. On a success, you can learn up to three rumors related to creatures or organizations involved in the mission, which come to you through your sending stone. These rumors reflect current or historical knowledge possessed by Acquisitions Incorporated or the organization's many contacts. Improved Rumor Mill: At rank 3, when you use your Rumor Mill feature, the DM provides you with a sense of which parts of a particular rumor are inaccurate, if any. You do not necessarily learn the truth behind those false rumors."

Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Frost Friend: You have resistance to fire damage. Icy Mantle: As an action, you can touch yourself or another creature with water on your finger. The water creates an icy mantle of protection. The next time within the next minute that the target takes bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, that damage is reduced to 0, and the mantle is destroyed. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Winters Howl: As an action, you can cast storm (spell save 17). You regain this ability after you finish a short or long rest. Gift of Frost: You can transfer the shard's magic to a nonmagical item—a cloak or a pair of boots-by tracing the ise rune there with your finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shard is destroyed, and the rune appears in blue on the chosen item, which gains a benefit based on its form:"

    "Description": "The amulet is a 4-inch-wide disk composed of silver-framed wood, with a rune carved into its face. A magic spell reveals a magical aura of enchantment around the amulet. Every guardian has an amulet magically linked to it. A shield guardian can have only one corresponding amulet, and if that amulet is destroyed, the shield guardian is incapacitated until a replacement amulet is created. A shield guardian's amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn't being worn or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components. A shield guardian's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer. The amulet's wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance. A humanoid that attunes to this amulet knows the distance and direction of the shield guardian, provided the amulet and the guardian are on the same plane of existence. As an action, the amulet's attuned wearer can try to reactivate the shield guardian, doing so with a successful 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Reactivation can only be attempted while the amulet and guardian are within 10 feet of each other."

The shield becomes a magic item once the eyes is implanted, whereupon the flayer can give the shield to a thrall or hang it on a wall in its lair. As long as the shield is on the same plane of existence as its creator, the flayer can see through the shield's eye, which has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

You can use a bonus action to activate the shield, causing glowing lava to flow through the shield's grooves for 1 minute.

Cleansing Fire: As an action, you can cause the shield to flare with the cleansing fire of the god Surtur. Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself (you can choose yourself). One disease or condition of your choice affecting this creature ends immediately; the condition can be blinded, charmed, deafened, or poisoned. Shield Bash: When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a shield bash, targeting one creature you can see within 5 feet of yourself. The target must make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage plus 3d6 fire damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. You can use Shield Bash only once per turn. Once the shield has been activated, it can't be activated again until the next dawn."

The Shield has the following additional properties that you can use while holding it. Forceful Bash: When you take the XPHB action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your Proficiency Bonus and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Force damage to the target equal to 2 plus your Strength modifier, and if the target is a creature, you can push it up to 10 feet directly away from yourself. If the creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock it down, giving it the XPHB condition. Protective Field: As a XPHB, when you or an ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack or makes a saving throw against an area of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot Emanation originating from you. When the Emanation appears, any creatures or objects not fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of effect that triggered the XPHB has no effect on creatures and objects inside the Emanation, which lasts as long as you maintain XPHB, up to 1 minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the Emanation. A creature or object inside the Emanation can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation damage anything outside it.

    "Description": "The Shield of the Hidden Lord is of celestial origin and serves as a prison for the pit fiend Gargauth, whose mortal followers revere it as a god. Over time, Gargauth's evil has warped the shield's appearance, so that its celestial motif and designs have become twisted into a fiendish face that subtly moves in disturbing ways. While holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage. Sentience: The Shield of the Hidden Lord is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties: The shield has an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24, as well as hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet. The shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper. The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast fireball or 2 charges to cast fire from the shield (save 21 for each). The fire spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Anytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can't use it again until the next dawn. Gargauth's Personality: Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can't escape on its own. The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape. While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it. Gargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there. Freeing Gargauth: Casting good on the shield has a 1 chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible."

While holding the shield, you benefit from the following properties. Winter's Friend: You are immune to cold damage. Deadly Rebuke: Immediately after a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 3d6 necrotic damage to that creature. Bane: You can cast the bane spell from the shield (save 17). The spell does not require concentration and lasts for 1 minute. Once you cast the spell from the shield, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. Gift of Vengeance: You can transfer the shield's magic to a nonmagical weapon by tracing the uven rune on the weapon with one finger. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the two items to be within 5 feet of each other. At the end, the shield is destroyed, and the rune is etched or burned into the chosen weapon. This weapon becomes a rare magic item that requires attunement. It has the properties of a +1 weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when the weapon is used against one of the following creature types, chosen by you at the time of the magic weapon's creation: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, or undead."

    "Description": "The blade of this rapier is made of spider silk. Its onyx pommel is tipped with a ruby cut in the shape of a spider, and the blade carries the blessing of Lolth. Sentience: Silken Spite is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, Elvish, and Undercommon. Personality: A murderous yochlol named Sinnafex lives within Silken Spite. The weapon speaks in whispers, pushing its wielder to trust no one and to kill those who cause the slightest personal offense. Dormant: The rapier grants the following benefits in its dormant state: You can speak, read, and write Abyssal, Elvish, and Undercommon. You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, being attuned to the rapier increases the range of your darkvision by 60 feet. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. You can use an action to cause poison to coat the rapier's blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the creature awake. While carrying the rapier, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were 3. Betrayer Artifact Properties: The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See Artifact Properties in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information."

    "Description": "Common coins come in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a belt pouch, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound."

The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed."

The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, it doesn't have or need a head, it has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit. While attuned to Snicker-Snack, you have proficiency with greatswords, and you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. Sentience: Snicker-Snack is a sentient, chaotic good greatsword with an Intelligence of 9, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can speak, read, and understand Common, and its voice sounds silvery and melodic. Snicker-Snack craves the destruction of evil Dragons and urges you to seek out these creatures and slay them. Snicker-Snack has a fickle personality. It ends its attunement to you if you miss on attack rolls with the weapon three times in a row. Each time you finish a long rest after that happens, you can attempt to regain the sword's trust by making a contested Charisma check against Snicker-Snack. If you win the contest, your attunement to the weapon is instantly restored. Your attunement to the weapon can't be restored in any other way."

    "Description": "Soul coins are about 5 inches across and about an inch thick, minted from infernal iron. Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse. Carrying Soul Coins: To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair. An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance). A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty. A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Using a Soul Coin: A soul coin has 3 charges. A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:  Freeing a Soul: Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges. The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils. A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a BGDIA or an infernal war machine's furnace (see Soul Fuel). Freeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature. Hellish Currency: Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered. Soul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes."

The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle. While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it.

The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast. If you're holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle."

    "Description": "The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a ship on which it has been installed through space and air. It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more. The sensation of being attuned to a spelljamming helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as painful. While attuned to a spelljamming helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell): You can use the spelljamming helm to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship's speed. If the ship is in space and no other objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it, you can use the spelljamming helm to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours. You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship. At any time, you can see and hear what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it. Transfer Attunement: You can use an action to touch a willing spellcaster. That creature attunes to the spelljamming helm immediately, and your attunement to it ends. Cost of a Spelljamming Helm: A spelljamming helm propels and steers a ship much as sails, oars, and rudders work on a seafaring vessel, and a spelljamming helm is easy to create if one has the proper spell. AAG has a material component cost of 5,000 gp, so that's the least one can pay to acquire a spelljamming helm. Wildspace merchants, including dohwars and mercanes (both described in BAM), typically sell a spelljamming helm for substantially more than it cost to make. How much more depends on the market, but 7,500 gp would be a reasonable demand. A desperate buyer in a seller's market might pay 10,000 gp or more."

A shard can be created blank or already filled with information. When the shard is created, the creator can set a passphrase that must be spoken to access the information stored within. While holding the shard, you can use an action to open your mind to the shard, seeing its content in your mind. On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing new text on blank pages in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write normally. Thinking of a particular phrase or topic draws you to the first section in the shard that addresses it. A wizard can use a spellshard as a spellbook, with the usual cost in gold and time to scribe a spell into the shard."

The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage. The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage. If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal. If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a hole, the DM determines randomly what happens, using the following table."

    "Description": "This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it. The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage. Controlling the Sphere: A Sphere of Annihilation is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a XPHB action to make a 25 Intelligence (XPHB) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line. While in control of the sphere, you can take a XPHB to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a 19 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 XPHB by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains. Sphere Interactions: If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the XPHB spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a Portable Hole), the DM determines randomly what happens using the following table."

As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges to give yourself or one other creature that you can see a d4. The recipient can roll this d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, damage roll, or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn. If this extra die is not used before then, it is lost. If you expend the staff's last charge, roll a d20. On a roll of 9 or lower, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff that breaks the first time it scores a hit and deals damage. On a roll of 10 or higher, the staff regains 1d6 of its expended charges."

Orb of Lightning: You create a Small orb of lightning in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. You concentrate on this orb as if concentrating on a spell.

The snake is under your control and shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the incapacitated condition.

If you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or if the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, the snake reverts to staff form in its current space. Thunderclap: You point the staff skyward, producing a fearsome thunderclap. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on you must succeed on a 15 Constitution saving throw or have the deafened and frightened conditions until the end of your next turn."

Etched into the skull's forehead is Acererak's rune, which is known on many worlds as a sign of death. Beneficial Properties: While the staff is on your person, you gain the following benefits: Your proficiency bonus to Intelligence (Arcana) and Intelligence (History) checks is doubled. You can't be blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, petrified, or stunned. Undead with a challenge rating of 2 or lower will neither threaten nor attack you unless you harm them. You can wield the staff as a +3 quarterstaff that deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a hit. Invoke Curse: The Staff of the Forgotten One has 7 charges and regains 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A restoration, curse, or similar spell ends the curse on the target. The Forgotten One: The bodiless life force of a dead archmage empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff's skull protects ToA from this spirit's vengeance. Each time a creature other than ToA expends any of the staff's charges, there is a 50 chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a good spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead archmage attempts to destroy the staff. Destroying the Staff: A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone's guess."

    "Description": "This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls. The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1 charges. Spell Absorption: While holding the staff, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below). Spells: While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: elemental (7 charges), magic (3 charges), fireball (7th-level version, 7 charges), sphere (2 charges), storm (4 charges), invisibility (2 charges), knock (2 charges), bolt (7th-level version, 7 charges), passwall (5 charges), shift (7 charges), telekinesis (5 charges), fire (4 charges), or web (2 charges). You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: lock, magic, enlarge/reduce, light, hand, or good. Retributive Strike: You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. You have a 50 chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage."

    "Description": "Rare legends and lore that speak of the Stone of Creation claim it fell to the Material Plane like a meteor from some distant edge of the Outer Planes or the Far Realm. Similar legends across various worlds, all describing stones that grow buildings and islands from magic, like a house from a seed, suggest the Stone of Creation is not a unique artifact—or that all the various pieces of it are derived from a single source of stone even larger than sages imagine. The raw, black stone appears flaky like slate but is as hard as granite and marbled with veins of gold and platinum. The original, complete Stone of Creation took the form of a blocky slab like a standing stone, but it may be impossible to know the Stone's true size, or if the concept of a whole Stone of Creation even applies to the artifact. Perhaps other slabs and boulders made from the Stone have been scattered across the multiverse, being cut down and recombed through interplanar movements and the magic of the artifacts themselves. Random Properties: The Stone of Creation has the following random properties: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 major beneficial property Stone Smithing: While attuned to the Stone of Creation, you are proficient with PHB and can use them to cut pieces from the Stone's slab, thereby creating lesser artifacts. Cut into Pieces: The Stone of Creation is a source for smaller artifacts that derive their power from it. These pieces allow you to shape and bestow a portion of the slab's power for yourself or others. You can cut pieces in two general sizes: a AitFR-AVT or a AitFR-AVT. These lesser artifacts require their own attunement. Up to eleven chips of creation can be created from the existing slab, plus up to nine keystones. A chip resembles a flake of rock about the size of an adult human's hand. A keystone is at least five times that thickness. When all chips and keystones have been cut away, a portion of the Stone remains but proves impervious to additional attempts to cut or chisel pieces from it. This smallest version of the Stone is the same size as a Tiny creature. Raze or Reshape Creations: Although the Stone of Creation cannot create structures or demiplanes of its own, while you are attuned to it you can revise or renovate any structure or demiplane created by a keystone or chip, provided you are within 1 mile of the Stone and you can see or otherwise perceive the structure or demiplane. For example, you may add doors, seal windows, change the arrangement of rooms, or even dispel a structure created by a keystone. To do so, you must concentrate for 1 minute, as if on a spell, while picturing the changes you wish to make in your mind; over the course of that minute, the changes slowly occur. These changes cannot deal damage or directly harm a creature. A dispelled structure gradually recedes and diminishes to nothing, leaving creatures unharmed. Destroying the Stone: The Stone of Creation is a strange artifact that can be divided into smaller artifacts, yet the Stone is impervious to most damage. Only the smith attuned to the Stone can carve it. Destroying the Stone's lesser, derived artifacts (and their creations) does no damage to the Stone itself. The Stone of Creation is destroyed if it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck with a forked metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the shift spell). The Stone then shatters into harmless, inert shards of rock. Places created by the slab's chips and keystones crumble, decay, or fade away to nothing after the Stone of Creation is destroyed. Whether the Stone of Creation is itself a piece of a larger artifact remains unknown."

    "Description": "The Stone of Golorr is a glossy, greenish-gray stone that fits in the palm of your hand. The stone is actually an aboleth named Golorr, transformed by magic into an object. Random Properties: The Stone of Golorr has the following properties, determined by rolling on the tables in the Artifacts section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide: 1 minor beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property Legend Lore: The Stone of Golorr has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the stone, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the lore spell. By using the stone to cast lore, you communicate directly with the aboleth, and it shares its knowledge with you. The aboleth can't lie to you, but the information it provides is often cryptic or vague. The aboleth knows where Lord Neverember's secret vault is located. It also knows that three keys are needed to open the vault and that a gold dragon named Aurinax inhabits the vault and guards its treasures. Failed Memory: When your attunement to the Stone of Golorr ends, you must make a 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you lose all memory of the stone being in your possession and all knowledge imparted by it. A curse spell cast on you has a 20 chance of restoring the lost knowledge and memories, and a restoration spell does so automatically. Sentience: The Stone of Golorr is a sentient lawful evil magic item with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can communicate telepathically with the creature that is attuned to it, as long as that creature understands at least one language. In addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone. The Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see Sentient Magic Items in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Personality: The Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god. Destroying the Stone: While in stone form, the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an antipathy/sympathy spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see."

Blade of Radiance: While grasping the hilt, you can take a XPHB to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic weapon functions as a Longsword with Finesse. If you are proficient with Longswords or Shortswords, you are proficient with the Sun Blade. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals Radiant damage instead of Slashing damage. When you hit an Undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage. Sunlight: The sword's luminous blade emits XPHB in a 15-foot radius and XPHB for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can take a XPHB action to expand or reduce its radius of XPHB and XPHB by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each."

    "Description": "The Sunsword is a unique blade once possessed by Strahd's brother, Sergei von Zarovich. In its original form, it had a platinum hilt and guard, and a thin crystal blade as strong as steel. Strahd employed a powerful wizard named Khazan to destroy the weapon after Sergei's death. The first part of the process required the hilt and the blade to be separated, which Khazan accomplished. While Khazan was busying himself destroying the blade, his apprentice stole the hilt and fled. Khazan later located his apprentice's mutilated corpse in the Svalich Woods, but the hilt was nowhere to be found. To avoid the vampire's wrath, Khazan told Strahd that the entire weapon had been destroyed. The hilt, which is sentient, knows that it can never be reunited with its original crystal blade. It has, however, gained the properties of a blade: While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the Sunsword. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. Sentience: The Sunsword is a sentient chaotic good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 17, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotions to the creature carrying it or wielding it. Personality: The Sunsword's special purpose is to destroy Strahd, not so much because it wants to free the land of Barovia from evil but because it wants revenge for the loss of its crystal blade. The weapon secretly fears its own destruction."

    "Description": "When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it. For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby. The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead. If the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder takes 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met. Random Properties: The Sword of Kas has the following random properties: 1 minor beneficial property 1 major beneficial property 1 minor detrimental property 1 major detrimental property Spirit of Kas: While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn. Spells: While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: lightning, word, or death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn. Sentience: The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. Personality: The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal. The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Vecna. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder. Destroying the Sword: A creature attuned to both the Vecna and the Vecna can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed."

    "Description": "This longsword belonged to the angel Zariel before her fall from grace. Fashioned from celestial steel, it gives off a faint glow and hum. The weapon chooses who can attune to it and who can't. It desires a wielder who embodies bravery and heroism. Attunement: The sword allows you to attune to it immediately, without having to take a short rest. The first time you attune to the sword, you are transformed into a heavenly, idealized version of yourself, blessed with otherworldly beauty and a touch of heaven in your heart. Neither magic nor divine intervention can reverse this transformation. Your alignment becomes lawful good, and you gain the following traits: New Personality: You gain new personality traits, determined by rolling once on each of the following tables. These traits override any conflicting personality trait, ideal, bond, or flaw. Holy Light: The sword sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Fiends find the sword's light disconcerting and painful, even if they can't see it, and have disadvantage on attack rolls made within the weapon's radius of bright light. As a bonus action, you can intensify the sword's light, causing it to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet, or reduce its glow to its normal intensity. Random Properties: The sword has 2 minor beneficial properties. Searing Radiance: The sword deals an extra 9 (2d8) radiant damage to any creature it hits, or 16 (3d10) radiant damage if you're wielding the weapon with two hands. An evil creature that takes this radiant damage must succeed on a 17 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Sentience: The Sword of Zariel is a sentient, lawful good item with an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet. The sword communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it. Truth Seer: While holding the sword, you gain advantage on all Wisdom (Insight) checks. Destroying the Sword: Zariel can destroy the sword simply by grasping it. She couldn't bring herself to do so when she was an angel, but as an archdevil she has no compunction about ridding the multiverse of the weapon. The sword is also destroyed if it's used to shatter the Companion (see shattering the companion), unless the blade is wielded by an angel of challenge rating 15 or higher, or a good-aligned cleric or paladin of at least 10th level. If Zariel is killed for good (that is, if she dies in the Nine Hells), the sword becomes no harder to destroy than a normal longsword."

The weapon's emerald blade can't be damaged or dulled, and the sword can't be teleported anywhere without its wielder while the two are attuned to one another. Spells: The sword has 6 charges and regains 2 expended charges daily at dawn. A creature attuned to the sword can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells from it without material components: fly (2 charges), polymorph (3 charges), or plants (4 charges). Sentience: The sword has an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates telepathically with its attuned wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, Elvish, and Sylvan. In addition, the sword can ascertain the true value of any gemstone brought within 5 feet of it. Personality: Tearulai admires great beauty, music, fine art, and poetry. Vain, the weapon strives to improve its appearance. It craves gemstones and seeks out better ones with which to adorn itself. Most of all, it longs to return to the forests around Myth Drannor, where it was created. If its wielder's goals run counter to its own, Tearulai attempts to take control of its wielder and escape Undermountain, whereupon it can use its plants spell to return whence it came. When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target. When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the effect of such loss determined by the DM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead. 4d6 slashing damage, although https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/174522/53884}. In addition, you can speak the sword's command to cause the blade to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the sword puts out the light."

The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life. Using the Teeth: While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later). If you don't sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below). Each tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth's result is rolled after it's been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table. Sowing Teeth: To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted. Implanting Teeth: To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect. Recovering Teeth: Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane. Destroying the Teeth: Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth's story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever."

If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, the spell uses your spellcasting ability; otherwise, if the spell requires a saving throw or an attack roll, the spell save DC is 13 and the attack bonus is +5. If your XPHB to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes. You can also cast the spell once without a spell slot and spell components. Once the spell is cast in this way, the tattoo vanishes. Inking Thayan Spell Tattoos: The Thayan art of magical tattooing is highly guarded by its practitioners, and thus, Thayan Spell Tattoos can't be crafted like other magic items. To learn how to ink Thayan Spell Tattoos, you must have a Renown Score of 50+ with the Red Wizards. To ink a Thayan Spell Tattoo, you must have proficiency in the XPHB skill and with XPHB and have the spell prepared each day of the inking. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed when you complete the tattoo. Inking a Thayan Spell Tattoo takes the same amount of Time and Cost as scribing a XDMG of an equivalent level."

Sentience: The Bloody End is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal. Personality: A tyrannical fiend named Izeelzee lives within The Bloody End. The weapon boisterously pushes its wielder to subjugate others and to never back down from a challenge. If the wielder doesn't demand fealty from others, the weapon is happy to demand it on their behalf. Dormant: The morningstar grants the following benefits in its dormant state: You can speak, read, and write Infernal. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While holding the morningstar, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save 13): person, person, or fear. Once a spell has been cast using the morningstar, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn. While holding the morningstar, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Betrayer Artifact Properties: The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See Artifact Properties in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information."

The remaining pages describe various priestly rituals and ceremonies in chilling detail.

    "Description": "This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console. Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed. The Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below. Silver Wire: The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an projection spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes invisible, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length. As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an projection's silvery cord—the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly. Any effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher. Summon Monster: When first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows: 1/day: animals, XGE 1/7 days: elementals, beings, XGE 1/month: elemental, fey Wish: The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a wish spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10 chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent. Random Properties: There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls than can ever be known or matrixed—especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates 1 random beneficial properties and 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play. Once set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long rest. (Our thanks to the D&D community for their suggestions for the properties of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!) Destroying the Machine: The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again."

    "Description": "This magic ranged weapon is a flared pistol with the storm rune engraved along the barrel. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It requires no ammunition, its damage is thunder instead of piercing, and it doesn't have the loading property. Invoking the Rune: As a bonus action, you can invoke the weapon's rune to launch a ball of energy to a point you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The energy then detonates into a 10-foot-radius sphere of turbulent wind and thunder centered on that point, and each creature in that sphere must make a 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 thunder damage, and it can't take reactions until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn."

The weapon deals an extra 1d8 Thunder damage to any creature it hits and an extra 3d8 Thunder damage to objects it hits that aren't being worn or carried. The weapon has the following additional properties. Clap of Thunder: As a XPHB action, you can strike the weapon against a hard surface to create a loud clap of thunder audible out to 300 feet. You also create a 30-foot Cone of thunderous energy. Each creature in the Cone must succeed on a 15 Strength saving throw or have the XPHB condition. Nonmagical objects in the Cone that aren't being worn or carried take 3d8 Thunder damage. Earthquake: As a XPHB action, you can strike the weapon against the ground to create an intense seismic disturbance in a 50-foot-radius circle centered on the point of impact. Structures in contact with the ground in that area take 50 Bludgeoning damage, and each creature on the ground in that area must succeed on a 20 Dexterity saving throw or have the XPHB condition. If that creature is also Concentrating, it must succeed on a 20 Constitution saving throw or its XPHB is broken. In addition, you can cause a 30-foot-deep, 10-foot-wide fissure to open up on the ground anywhere in the area. Any creature on a spot where the fissure opens must make a 20 Dexterity saving throw, falling into the fissure on a failed save or moving with the fissure's edge on a successful one. Any structure on a spot where the fissure opens collapses into the fissure. Once you use this property, it can't be used again until the next dawn."

The original copies were made by wyrmspeakers of the Cult of the Dragon and bear that cult's symbol on their cover. The Tome of the Dragon contains the secret ritual to transform a dragon or a dead dragon's body into a dracolich. To decipher and use the Tome of the Dragon, you must be either a spellcaster with at least two level 5 spell slots or a Dragon. A single assistant (or more, at the DM's discretion) can help you conduct the ritual, so long as that assistant also meets the requirements to use the tome. To create a dracolich using a Tome of the Dragon, you must have continuous access to the body of an adult or ancient dragon (either living or dead), as well as 80,000 GP worth of supplies (which includes a gem that will serve as the anchor for the dracolich's spirit). While you have the necessary materials, you must conduct a ritual that lasts 180 days divided by the number of creatures conducting the ritual. During the ritual, you and any assistants must work without interruption, resting no more than 8 hours per day. If you are a Dragon, the cost of supplies and the ritual's duration are halved. When the ritual is complete, the tome explodes with violet light, dealing (12d6) Necrotic damage to you and each assistant. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 XPHB, the creature is killed and immediately reanimates as a XMM under the DM's control. At the end of the ritual, the target transforms into a XMM. If the ritual's target was a living dragon, that dragon dies instantly, and its spirit is transferred to the gem supplied for the ritual. If the target was a dead dragon's body, the body reanimates, and the gem is inhabited by an evil dragon spirit from the Outer Planes. The dracolich is under no obligation toward its creators and acts according to its nature."

    "Description": "CoA} Crafted from the very glacier in which he was imprisoned, the True-Ice Shards are a rapier and parrying dagger (main gauche) pair used by Levistus. They exemplify his time spent in the glacier, augmenting telepathy, divination, and defense. Due to his control over ice, Levistus can conjure the True-Ice Shards from anywhere, including if they were destroyed. When using the magic dagger, you gain a +3 bonus to your AC, as long as it is used as your offhand weapon, and it does 1d6 cold damage instead of its regular damage. Because Levistus conjures the True-Ice Shards at will, he often rewards a copy of the artifact to his most loyal followers. The copies are identical to the original with one exception: Levistus can destroy or retrieve a copy at any time. Random Properties: The True-Ice Shards have the following random properties: 2 major beneficial properties 2 minor detrimental properties 1 major detrimental property Sub-Zero: Cold damage dealt with the shards ignores resistances and immunities. Creatures vulnerable to cold damage take triple damage from the True-Ice Shards, rather than double. After you damage a creature with the shards, you may use a bonus action to force the creature to make a 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature that took the damage becomes vulnerable to cold damage for 24 hours. Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until after you have finished a long rest. Mental Command: While attuned to the True-Ice Shards, you can use an action to cast the Thoughts spell (save 20), targeting any creature you have previously met. If the targeted creature is on a different plane of existence, the spell fails. As long as you maintain concentration, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to the focused creature. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—as long as the focus and concentration continue. Omniscient: You can use the True-Ice Shards to cast a variety of divination spells. Plants, Creature, and Object may be cast at will, and don't have a maximum range. Other limitations of the spells still apply, and they can't detect subjects on other planes of existence. Additionally, you may cast Scrying (with a spell save DC of 20) and Path. Once either spell is cast, you must finish a long rest before casting either of them again. Destroying the Shards: While Levistus still lives, destroying the True-Ice Shards serves little purpose, as he is capable of recreating them at will. That aside, the shards can be destroyed when subjected to a sufficient source of heat. A few such sources include the inside of an active volcano, a continuous source of Hellfire, or a powerful fire spell cast at 9th level."

Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed, you must make a 11 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul is drawn from your body and trapped in an object on a different plane of existence.

    "Description": "The ghastly Wand of Orcus rarely leaves Orcus's side. The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord's aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. MTF allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal. Made from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by MTF. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence. Any creature besides MTF that tries to attune to the wand must make a 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a zombie. In the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic phb that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit. Random Properties: The Wand of Orcus has the following random properties: 2 minor beneficial properties 1 major beneficial property 2 minor detrimental properties 1 major detrimental property The detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to MTF himself. Protection: You gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand. Spells: The wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save 18) from it: dead (1 charge), blight (2 charges), death (3 charges), death (3 charges), kill (4 charges), or dead (1 charge). The wand regains 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While attuned to the wand, MTF or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0). Call Undead: While you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points. The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn. While attuned to the wand, MTF can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until MTF dismisses them. Sentience: The Wand of Orcus is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common. Personality: The wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow MTF. Destroying the Wand: Destroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that MTF has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded. Bathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss."

It can also speak with aquatic animals as if using a animals spell, using telepathy to involve its wielder in the conversation. Personality: When it grows restless, Wave has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the sea gods. Wave zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon's objectives in the world. The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of devotion to—or rebellion against—that god. Wave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's demise. This destiny is something Wave might not be able to avert."

The tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points destroys it and the weird contained within it."

    "Description": "Whelm is a powerful warhammer forged by dwarves and lost in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. At dawn the day after you first make an attack roll with Whelm, you develop a fear of being outdoors that persists as long as you remain attuned to the weapon. This causes you to have disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks while you can see the daytime sky. Thrown Weapon: Whelm has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant. Each time you throw the weapon, it flies back to your hand after the attack. If you don't have a hand free, the weapon lands at your feet. Shock Wave: You can use an action to strike the ground with Whelm and send a shock wave out from the point of impact. Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. Supernatural Awareness: While you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast good or object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn. Sentience: Whelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Dwarvish, Giant, and Goblin. It shouts battle cries in Dwarvish when used in combat. Personality: Whelm's purpose is to slaughter giants and goblinoids. It also seeks to protect dwarves against all enemies. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to destroy goblins and giants or to protect dwarves. Whelm has ties to the dwarf clan that created it, variously called the Dankil or the Mightyhammer clan. It longs to be returned to that clan. It would do anything to protect those dwarves from harm. The hammer also carries a secret shame. Centuries ago, a dwarf named Ctenmiir wielded it valiantly for a time. But Ctenmiir was turned into a vampire. His will was strong enough that he bent Whelm to his evil purposes, even killing members of his own clan."

Legendary Resistance: (1/Day) If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Winter's Fury: While your current hit points are equal to or less than half your hit point maximum, you deal an extra 1d8 cold damage with your melee attacks."

    "Description": "Black, blue, green, red, and white gems carved in the form of dragon heads cover this ostentatious gold war pick, marking it as a weapon channeling the power of Tiamat. Sentience: Will of the Talon is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common, Draconic, and Infernal. Personality: A short-tempered devil named Ashtyrlon lives within Will of the Talon. The weapon is greedy and values strong leadership. It demands that its wielder take decisive action to keep order in high-pressure situations—and to always take a fair share of treasure in return. Dormant: The war pick grants the following benefits in its dormant state: You can speak, read, and write Draconic and Infernal. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. As a bonus action while holding the war pick, you can cause the following effect: each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you and is aware of you must succeed on a 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to your Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. While holding the war pick, you can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Pick a damage type from the Will of the Talon Breath Weapons table. Each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a 13 saving throw, the type of which is specified in the table. A creature takes 3d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When you use the war pick to unleash a breath weapon of a specific damage type, you can't choose that same damage type again until the next dawn. Betrayer Artifact Properties: The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one minor beneficial property and one minor detrimental property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional minor beneficial property and an additional minor detrimental property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a major beneficial property. See Artifact Properties in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information."

In addition, the vane deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on a hit. Sense Mood: While the vane is inside the perimeter of the Witchlight Carnival, it can sense the mood of every creature in the carnival that has an Intelligence of 4 or higher. As an action, a creature attuned to the vane can use it to pinpoint the location of the happiest creature in the carnival. The butterfly shape at the top of the vane spins slowly clockwise when spirits in the carnival are generally high; if the general mood in the carnival is dour, the top of the vane spins slowly counterclockwise. Sentience: The vane is a sentient, chaotic good wondrous item with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 30 feet, and it communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature attuned to it.

Additional Properties: The vane has the following additional properties: The creature holding the vane has vulnerability to lightning damage.

This light causes the henge to cast shadows, and these shadows allow the watch's owner to track the passage of time. Carnival Setup and Takedown: The creature attuned to the watch can use an action to initiate the packing up or the unpacking of the Witchlight Carnival, provided the creature and the carnival are on the same plane of existence. In the span of 1 hour, all objects that are elements of the carnival are magically whisked about until everything is packed up and ready for travel, or unpacked and assembled. The watch has no effect on creatures, which can move about freely and safely while the carnival is being set up or taken down. Once the process of packing up or unpacking the carnival begins, it can't be stopped until the task is complete. When the watch is used to pack up or unpack the carnival, this property cannot be used again until 8 hours have elapsed. Additional Properties: The pocket watch has the following additional properties: While carrying the watch, the creature attuned to it can cast the bolt, invisibility, or message spell as an action, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability. After the watch's invisibility spell is cast, roll a d8; on a roll of 3 or 8, the watch can't be used to cast this spell again until the next dawn. The creature attuned to the watch gains 30 pounds. This extra weight vanishes when the attunement ends. The creature attuned to the watch must eat and drink eight times the normal amount each day."

    "Description": "Constructed from the same materials as his tower, Dispater's Wrought-Iron Tower is a powerful weapon that marks his rule over Dis. It embodies his ideals, representing defense, authority, and power. Its construction changes hourly, similar to the tower, appearing as either iron, steel, lead, or adamantine. The Wrought-Iron Tower is a magic staff that functions as a warhammer and you have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If a creature is vulnerable to a certain type of damage, all damage dealt with the staff is converted to that damage type. When you hit a good aligned creature with it, that creature takes an extra 3d6 fire damage. While holding the staff, you can control and navigate through the Iron Tower in Dis. While the staff is on the layer of Dis, Dispater knows the exact location of it, and is capable of teleporting to within 30 feet of it at will. Random Properties: The Wrought-Iron Tower has the following random properties: 2 minor beneficial properties. The Best Offense: While attuned to the staff, you have a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to all saving throws. Additionally, the staff has 10 charges. When you make an attack, you may spend 1 or more charges. For each charge spent, you deal an additional 2 fire damage on a successful attack. Charges are still consumed if the attack misses. The staff regains all charges each day at dawn. After dealing damage with the staff, you may use a bonus action and expend 1 charge to replace the damage dealt with your total AC instead. Rulership: The Wrought-Iron Tower also functions as a Rulership, with an increased save DC of 18. This property costs 3 charges to use, though a creature that successfully saves against one of its uses is immune to future uses for 24 hours. Slag: You can cast Smite at 6th level on yourself, expending 1 charge. Instead of doing fire damage, you may have Searing Smite inflict acid damage. The spell requires no concentration and lasts for 1 minute. Destroying the Staff: The Wrought-Iron Tower can only be destroyed inside the Iron Tower on Dis. Located somewhere within the tower is the forge that Dispater used to create the staff. An attuned creature must place the staff into the forge fires, then cast Good and touch the staff. They then take 20d10 fire damage, which ignores resistance and immunities. If the attuned creature survives the fire damage, the staff is destroyed."

You have resistance to the chosen damage type until you finish another long rest. Invoking the Runes: As a bonus action, you can invoke the gauntlets' runes and summon two enormous spectral fists that envelop the gauntlets and mimic your hand motions. The fists can also launch themselves to strike distant opponents, returning immediately to your space after they hit or miss. The fists last for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. While the spectral fists are active, unarmed strikes you make on your turn have a reach of 30 feet, and when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack made with your unarmed strike, the creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or have the prone condition. Once the runes have been invoked, they can't be invoked again until the next dawn."

    "Description": "Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven empire. The Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet—the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated. After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership. Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne. Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic—the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master. Properties of the Throne: The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Sceptor in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows: The throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges. Both the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges. As an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast bolt (spell save 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls. As an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne. As an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute. At the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon's bite and claw attacks. Destroying the Throne: The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."

    "Description": "A mythallar looks like an enormous crystal ball held in an ornate cradle. The globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used mythallars to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter. The Ythryn mythallar is a relatively small device—a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this mythallar, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the mythallar. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the Ythryn mythallar follows the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the mythallar, nothing happens. All creatures attuned to the Ythryn mythallar can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The Ythryn mythallar's properties are as follows: While you're on the same plane of existence as the Ythryn mythallar, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The Ythryn mythallar and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion. As an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the Ythryn mythallar again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own. You can use the Ythryn mythallar to cast the weather spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar or the spell fails. Touching the Mythallar: Any creature that touches the globe of the mythallar must make a 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 180 (70) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact or the mythallar's cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save)."
